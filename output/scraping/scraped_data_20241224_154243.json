They have been an adaptable partner to help navigate the ever-changing world of Covid supplies/needs.” Genevieve KershRCI COVID Safety “Children have especially suffered both in terms of education and socialization. Many have lost an entire year or more of in-person learning, and an entire age set is now lagging. Like many K-8 schools around the country, Woodside Elementary School has fought hard to stay open. Recently, though, in the midst of the Omicron spike, California passed a negative testing mandate for both kids and teachers to return to school. Within days of shutting down, we reached out to Peach Medical for help. Short-staffed with many COVID cases of their own, they jumped through hoops for us and supplied us with our first shipment over a holiday weekend.” Larry BowmanSuperintendent Woodside School District \"Great experience!

Many have lost an entire year or more of in-person learning, and an entire age set is now lagging. Like many K-8 schools around the country, Woodside Elementary School has fought hard to stay open. Recently, though, in the midst of the Omicron spike, California passed a negative testing mandate for both kids and teachers to return to school.

Recently, though, in the midst of the Omicron spike, California passed a negative testing mandate for both kids and teachers to return to school. Within days of shutting down, we reached out to Peach Medical for help. Short-staffed with many COVID cases of their own, they jumped through hoops for us and supplied us with our first shipment over a holiday weekend.” Larry BowmanSuperintendent Woodside School District “Children have especially suffered both in terms of education and socialization.

Early Georgia Sodas – the Bottles and Proprietors If there was such a degree as a doctorate in research, David Kyle Rakes would hold it. And, if such a degree in design existed, Ferdinand Meyer V would own it. The degrees may be mystical, but that pair has become a team and from that teamwork has evolved absolutely one of the best books sure to be treasured by collectors of Georgia’s 19th-century soda bottles. Read More Dingen’s Napolean Cocktail Bitters Display One of the most interesting and visually exciting figural bitters bottles is Napolean Cocktail Bitters put out by the Dingens Brothers in Buffalo, New York. The banjo-lady’s leg form is unique for a bitters bottle and must have had a great shelf presence wherever it was sold be it in grocery stores or taverns. Bitters were being sold as medicines even though they were full of alcohol to avoid liquor taxes. These figural bottles further distanced the product from your typical whiskey bottle and made it more “acceptable” to buy with your weekly groceries. VISIT MUSEUM Three Great-Looking Dr. Wonser’s USA Bitters Squares After looking at the masterful mold design for Dr. Wonser’s U.S.A. Indian Root Bitters in a cylinder form (we have three examples in our museum), we now look at a square bottle embossed ‘DR. WONSER’S BITTERS’. The bottle also is embossed ‘USA’ on a second side panel. The third and fourth sides are blank and are where the label would have gone. The square bottle came after the cylinder bottle. The bottles are found in blue and green aquamarine. All are very lightly embossed. SEE MORE Elias Henry Van Benschoten and his Pickle Bottles Of Dutch stock, Elias Henry Van Benschoten was born in Beekman, Dutchess Co., New York on April 28, 1814 to Henry Teunise Van Benschoten (also spelled “Van Bunschoten” or “Van Bunschooten” and Mary Jackson. Elias would marry Phoebe Kissam Underhill and they had four children, William N., Mary E., Agusta, and John N. Van Benschoten. See the bottle and read more. Hexagonal Gothic Peppersauce Bottles Sauces and condiments for foods were marketed as a necessity prior to the food preservation advances of the 20th century. The foods available during the 18th and 19th centuries were often bland, of dubious quality and origin and effective date-stamping did not exist. This led the way for the preparation and use of a wide variety of sauces to either enhance the food flavor or cover up any off-flavors. See and Read About The legendary GII-57 “J.P.F. Eagle – Cornucopia “Conn” flask The GII-57 “J.P.F.” Eagle – Cornucopia and “Conn.” flask is a great rarity from an important Connecticut glass house. The flask is attributed to the Pitkin Glass Works from the Orford Parish of East Hartford, Connecticut. For most of its active existence, the Pitkin Glass Works was located in East Hartford until it became part of Manchester in 1823 when Manchester incorporated to become a separate town. The flask was made between 1815 and 1830. See and read all about this unique flask. Call For Historical Information The FOHBC, led by board member Michael Seeliger, has started a major new initiative to preserve our history. We would like your assistance in locating potentially long-lost images before it is too late as they could potentially be forgotten forever. We are looking for photographs, either in black and white or color of the great collections, collectors, bottle shows and displays of yesteryear. Our goal is to gather, enhance, and index this material digitally and make it available to our members and collectors for generations to come. More Info Bitters Bottles Supplement 2 Update – Available for Ordering! This monumental effort culminates a massive amount of work over many years. Carefully verified and cross-referenced with Bill Ham’s collected information and the Peachridge Glass database with 38,000 plus images and hundreds of files of obscure bitters. Lots of new bottles and information since 2004 when Bitters Bottle Supplement was published. Besides new and updated bottles and advertising, there are color plate sections on rare bitters, bitters facsimile bank notes, bitters postal covers, bitters almanacs, shell cards and tokens. For ephemera, the great museum-destined archives of Dan Cowman, Joe Gourd and Ben Swanson, among others, have been included. Additionally, the Index has been totally re-done to include all three books. Every documented bitters ever produced, and their makers have been indexed. This is a great tool! Thanks to Bill Ham, Joe Gourd, Ben Swanson and Jeff Burkhardt for their contributions. Research, design, and book layout by Ferdinand Meyer V. Every bottle has a story! INFO Pineapple Bitters One of my favorite bottles is the Pineapple Bitters. Affluent colonists would throw dinner parties and display a pineapple as the centerpiece, projecting a symbol of their wealth, hospitality, and status. Check it out in the FOHBC Virtual Museum Bitters Gallery. Historical text updated today with a few more visuals. Remember the pineapple girl from the 2019 FOHBC Augusta National? The “Tippecanoe” GVII-2 Figural Cabin “Tippecanoe” is a nickname for William Henry Harrison from his role in the Battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison was also the ninth president of the United States from March 1841 to April 1841. “Tippecanoe” is also embossed on one of the finest pieces of early American glass ever made. William Henry Harrison was born in Charles City County, Virginia, the son of … See and read more The GI-94 Franklin – Dyott historical flask Thomas W. Dyott, the self-proclaimed “king” of American patent medicine, was a great entrepreneur who took advantage of political events and slogans from the times and interpreted them onto his pictorial flasks. This was a clever marketing ploy that netted him great profits with his customer base and audience. This astute merchandising is very evident on our GI-94 flask as Dyott capitalized on the popularity of Benjamin Franklin. See and Read More Two fantastic Shriver’s Baltimore Oyster Ketchup bottles added to the Virtual Museum Oyster bars were popular establishments starting in the early to mid-1800s and could be found in eastern cities such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore that were close to the Atlantic oyster beds. The Dorlon & Shaffer Oyster House at Fulton Market in New York City was famous nationally and even internationally to travelers to the big city. The Union Oyster House in Boston is the oldest continuously open restaurant in the United States as it opened in 1826. Baltimore was the epicenter of seafood at that time with its proximity to the Chesapeake Bay. Visit the Food & Sauces Gallery and read all about it. American Life Bitters top bottle in the Glass Works Auction Premier Auction #143 Here is a really great looking rectangular figural bitters cabin with a curved roof rather than angular like most cabin bitters. The American Life Bitters is pretty tough to obtain and there are two variants. Our museum example is extremely rare and possibly unique in color. For the most part, this bottle story is about the inventor, Peter E. Iler, who was born in Wooster, Ohio in 1840. He eventually ended up in Omaha, Nebraska. His famous bitters have either the Tiffin, Ohio, or Omaha, Nebraska embossing. READ MORE A spectacular two-tone amber Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters Here is a spectacular example of a two-tone amber Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters from the Steven Hubbell collection. This new spinner was added to the existing page for the mint green Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters. Both examples are extraordinary and will stand together in the Bitters Gallery. Alan DeMaison really did a great job imaging this bottle. Louis Lacour was born on February 26, 1821, in Saint-Fargeau, Borough of Joigny, Departement of l’Yvonne, region of Burgundy, France which is about 120 miles southeast of Paris. Lacour left Paris in 1849, and came to California, via New York, as he had heard of the California gold rush. SEE BOTTLE AT & Co. – Asher Taylor & Co. We just added a great example of the unusual AT & Co (Asher Taylor & Co.) bottle to the FOHBC Virtual Museum Bitters Gallery. A good many of the AT & Co bottles were found at the legendary 1998 dig at an old 19th-century bottle recycling plant in San Francisco, California. Twenty-five to thirty of these bottles, in various conditions, were found in great-looking shades of amber, olive amber, yellow amber, and yellow-olive. At the same dig, many other western bitters were found in subterranean caches near the AT & Co bottles. READ MORE A fine Fautz’s Family Medicines – Baltimore from the Ben Swanson Collection S. A. Foutz is Solomon A. Foutz. In 1857 or so, Solomon went into business with his brother David E. Foutz as S. A. Foutz & Bro. in Baltimore and manufactured and extensively sold such remedies known as “Foutz’s Horse and Cattle Powders” and “Foutz’s Liniment”. In 1867 Solomon sold out to his brother for a considerable sum of money. David E. Foutz became sole owner of all of the secret formulas, names, good will, stock of goods, and materials connected with the business. David kept the S. A. Foutz & Bro. name and until his death in 1877. Business was later conducted by his widow which evolved into a Trade-Marks and Trade Names – Unlawful Competition lawsuit. READ MORE Arthur’s Patent 1855 – Arthur, Burnham & Gilroy Philadelphia Like carved ice, an extremely rare Arthur’s Patent 1855 – Arthur, Burnham & Gilroy Philadelphia clear pint now in the FOHBC Virtual Museum Jar Gallery. Alan DeMaison did an amazing job on the piece of clear glass. The most difficult to photograph. This is the second Dr. Robert Arthur piece in the museum. Both from the 1850s. SEE THE JAR The Wormser Bros San Francisco figural barrel – whiskey or bitters? Most antique bottle collectors believe that this figural barrel-shaped bottle was a bitters product. In most cases, if a proprietor had a liquor like bourbon or whiskey, he would use a traditional long neck round bottle in quarts and fifths and use a smaller pint and half-pint flask for lesser amounts. If a proprietor had a bitters to market, he might for example use a figural barrel, cabin, or square bottle. The irony is that these products, whether it was a whiskey or bitters, contained a large amount of alcohol. It is all about marketing and who you are selling to. Unfortunately, we have no advertising to confirm this bitters assertion though it is recorded that an example with a partial label was found in Nevada. We have not seen this example. READ MORE Sanded Patd Sept 25th 1877 Target Balls See a gorgeous deep teal, almost peacock blue target ball that is embossed PATD SEPT 25TH 1877 around the shoulder. Also a medium grass green example in a full rotation in the FOHBC Virtual Museum. These balls are 3-piece molds with an overall pebbly or sandy finish to the glass with a sheared mouth. These ‘sand balls’ are called just that because as they were cooling, they rolled the ball in very fine sand, which embedded into the glass, causing a more coarse surface. This allowed for better penetration of the ball by the shooter. The ball is 2 5/8″ in diameter and perfect. SEE THE TARGET BALLS A. Stone & Co. Cunninghams & Co. Philadelphia in olive green This is the earliest Stone Jar. Our quart A. Stone & Co. groove ring wax sealer jar in this beautiful olive green glass color is unique. The jar has a high kick-up, bare iron pontil scar. These rare jars are usually found in aqua and can also be found in half-gallons. Two California Wine Bitters now spinning in the FOHBC Virtual Museum California Wine Bitters is an extremely desirable, top-25 western bitters that is considered very rare. The round cylinder bottles are typically found in beautiful shades of green. A western collector once noted that of the ten or so examples he had either owned, handled, or seen, each was a different green color. Of the specimens that are known, the bottles have been found in the eastern and western United States. It was reported that a whole example was found at a mining camp near Desert Hills, Arizona, 35 miles from Apache Junction and one example came from an early river town in the Northern Sacramento Valley. Broken examples have been found in San Francisco and a few examples have even been found under buildings in New Hampshire. SEE EXAMPLES A. Stone & Co. Philada. wax sealer In aquamarine This early, small-mouth, quart wax sealer jar is embossed A. STONE & Co. in an arch on the face of the container. The ‘O’ in ‘Co.’ is smaller. Centered beneath, in a horizontal line, is PHILADA. The last ‘A’ is smaller. This same information is typically embossed on the glass stopper. The unusual narrow mouth glass stopper is typically found on their pint jars. The bottoms are usually unmarked and smooth. “All must surrender to Constitution Bitters” Here is an extraordinary rectangular Constitution Bitters in a medium pink amethyst or puce glass coloration. These bottles are typically found in shades of amber. This Constitution Bitters brand (there is another figural bottle with the same name), we are dealing with Stephen B. Seward and Burr S. Bentley of Seward & Bentley in Buffalo, New York. There are also listings for Seward, Bentley & Cheney, Ward & Bentley, and Daniel Seward & Co., that show obvious changes in partnership and ownership later in the 1860s. Stephen Seward even got his start earlier than that as his name occurs as S. B. Seward in the late 1850s on bottles and advertising etc. When this bottle mold was produced, Cheney had not yet joined the firm. READ & SEE MORE An Unusual Dark Teal Green Jar Free-blown means glass-forming by blowing and manipulating by hand and tools without the aid of a mold to shape the bottle. A free-blown bottle has no mold seams or other mold-induced markings. Our museum example represents a type of jar produced in the Pittsburgh District which typically comprises Louisville, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh geographic… Dorlon & Shaffer Pickled Oysters Back on the saddle so to speak. The FOHBC Virtual Museum site had more issues that started last Friday morning that prevented me from posting. Actually, four (4) web sites that I oversee went down during this period. FMG Design, Peachridge Glass, FOHBC, and the FOHBC Virtual Museum. Been a challenge, working with Miguel Ruiz to get back up in an environment where service has dropped or been prolonged due to the Coronavirus. I think layoffs are involved too. Anyway, here is a wonderful Dorlon & Shaffer Pickled Oysters jar with a story that I started last week and just completed. Would make a good story in Bottles and Extras. 2019 FOHBC 50th Anniversary National Antique Bottle Convention | Augusta, Georgia | Souvenir Program Well, the show is over and we are catching our breath. A couple of years of work boiling down to three or four intense days in Augusta. Now as the dust settles, we settle our accounts, collects some comments, look thru a couple thousand images and prepare for write-ups in Bottles and Extras and Antique Bottle & Glass Collector. A special shout-out to advertisers in our Souvenir Program. An important source of revenue and information. [Read] Pond’s Bitters “Makes You Go Some” Pond’s Bitters is named after George Morgan Pond who was born in Tareytown, New York on 29 May 1854. Tarrytown is a village in the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County, New York. It is located on the eastern bank of the Hudson River, about 25 miles north of midtown Manhattan in New York City. He was the son of Loyal Sylvester Pond (Vermont) and Harriet Sarah Taylor (New Hampshire). He later married Louise Fitch in 1882. Their children were Annie, Kate, George Jr., Guy and Rainsferd Pond. If you can’t do business, drink Rex Bitters – Chicago Here is what I call a telephone bitters. A bitters product so late that you could call your favorite saloon, liquor or drug store and order a case of Rex Bitters using your Chicago Telephone Company issued telephone, if you were fortunate enough to have one. Illinois Bell would not form until 1923 when they began automatic telephone service in Chicago. Jacob & David Hostetter – Dr. J. Hostetter’s Celebrated Stomach Bitters David Hostetter was a millionaire manufacturer of one of the most, if not the most famous and successful bitters ever produced, the Dr. J. Hostetter’s Celebrated Stomach Bitters. Much has been written about the brand. I thought I would try to tie it all together. Of Dutch extraction, David Hostetter was the eldest child of Jacob Hostetter by his wife Mary Landis, and was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on 23 January 1819. Dr. Jacob Hostetter was born on 13 October 1785 in York County, Pennsylvania… Bininger Gallery Update I have been nesting some great images of Bininger bottles for the past year or so waiting for a few missing pictures to justify a post gallery. With the Glass Works Auctions | Auction #96 additions, I can now release this post. If you have any additions of any different bottles, please send to me. My interest in Bininger’s started early with figural clock, cannon and barrel additions to go with my bitters collection. Many of us do this as the Bininger name means great bottles and history. Post Update with early use info: Log Cabin Series – Drake’s Plantation Bitters This medicinal make-up was unknown until the middle of the seventeenth century. The natives of Peru were generally supposed to have been long previously acquainted with its most wonderful medicinal qualities. Humbboldt makes favorable mention of the febrifuge qualities of this article as an antidote to Fever and Ague, Intermittent and Malarious Fevers, in his extensive South American travels. The Countess, wife of the Viceroy of Peru, having in her own person experienced the beneficial effects of the bark, is said, on her return to Spain … 4 Responses to Antique Bottle and Glass News Warren Friedrich says: 20 April 2011 at 6:13 pm I’ve just spent several hours perusing this website for Antique Bottle Collectors, I have to say this is the most comprehensive internet site ever developed for the antique bottle enthusiast.

FOHBC Virtual Museum Still Open Free Visit Now January — February 2022 Issue of Bottles and Extras mails to members After a long run, this is the LAST issue of Bottles and Extras. The next issue will be called Antique Bottle & Glass Collector as a result of the magazine merger.

Early Georgia Sodas – the Bottles and Proprietors If there was such a degree as a doctorate in research, David Kyle Rakes would hold it. And, if such a degree in design existed, Ferdinand Meyer V would own it. The degrees may be mystical, but that pair has become a team and from that teamwork has evolved absolutely one of the best books sure to be treasured by collectors of Georgia’s 19th-century soda bottles. Read More Dingen’s Napolean Cocktail Bitters Display One of the most interesting and visually exciting figural bitters bottles is Napolean Cocktail Bitters put out by the Dingens Brothers in Buffalo, New York. The banjo-lady’s leg form is unique for a bitters bottle and must have had a great shelf presence wherever it was sold be it in grocery stores or taverns. Bitters were being sold as medicines even though they were full of alcohol to avoid liquor taxes. These figural bottles further distanced the product from your typical whiskey bottle and made it more “acceptable” to buy with your weekly groceries. VISIT MUSEUM Three Great-Looking Dr. Wonser’s USA Bitters Squares After looking at the masterful mold design for Dr. Wonser’s U.S.A. Indian Root Bitters in a cylinder form (we have three examples in our museum), we now look at a square bottle embossed ‘DR. WONSER’S BITTERS’. The bottle also is embossed ‘USA’ on a second side panel. The third and fourth sides are blank and are where the label would have gone. The square bottle came after the cylinder bottle. The bottles are found in blue and green aquamarine. All are very lightly embossed. SEE MORE Elias Henry Van Benschoten and his Pickle Bottles Of Dutch stock, Elias Henry Van Benschoten was born in Beekman, Dutchess Co., New York on April 28, 1814 to Henry Teunise Van Benschoten (also spelled “Van Bunschoten” or “Van Bunschooten” and Mary Jackson. Elias would marry Phoebe Kissam Underhill and they had four children, William N., Mary E., Agusta, and John N. Van Benschoten. See the bottle and read more. Hexagonal Gothic Peppersauce Bottles Sauces and condiments for foods were marketed as a necessity prior to the food preservation advances of the 20th century. The foods available during the 18th and 19th centuries were often bland, of dubious quality and origin and effective date-stamping did not exist. This led the way for the preparation and use of a wide variety of sauces to either enhance the food flavor or cover up any off-flavors. See and Read About The legendary GII-57 “J.P.F. Eagle – Cornucopia “Conn” flask The GII-57 “J.P.F.” Eagle – Cornucopia and “Conn.” flask is a great rarity from an important Connecticut glass house. The flask is attributed to the Pitkin Glass Works from the Orford Parish of East Hartford, Connecticut. For most of its active existence, the Pitkin Glass Works was located in East Hartford until it became part of Manchester in 1823 when Manchester incorporated to become a separate town. The flask was made between 1815 and 1830. See and read all about this unique flask. Call For Historical Information The FOHBC, led by board member Michael Seeliger, has started a major new initiative to preserve our history. We would like your assistance in locating potentially long-lost images before it is too late as they could potentially be forgotten forever. We are looking for photographs, either in black and white or color of the great collections, collectors, bottle shows and displays of yesteryear. Our goal is to gather, enhance, and index this material digitally and make it available to our members and collectors for generations to come. More Info Bitters Bottles Supplement 2 Update – Available for Ordering! This monumental effort culminates a massive amount of work over many years. Carefully verified and cross-referenced with Bill Ham’s collected information and the Peachridge Glass database with 38,000 plus images and hundreds of files of obscure bitters. Lots of new bottles and information since 2004 when Bitters Bottle Supplement was published. Besides new and updated bottles and advertising, there are color plate sections on rare bitters, bitters facsimile bank notes, bitters postal covers, bitters almanacs, shell cards and tokens. For ephemera, the great museum-destined archives of Dan Cowman, Joe Gourd and Ben Swanson, among others, have been included. Additionally, the Index has been totally re-done to include all three books. Every documented bitters ever produced, and their makers have been indexed. This is a great tool! Thanks to Bill Ham, Joe Gourd, Ben Swanson and Jeff Burkhardt for their contributions. Research, design, and book layout by Ferdinand Meyer V. Every bottle has a story! INFO Pineapple Bitters One of my favorite bottles is the Pineapple Bitters. Affluent colonists would throw dinner parties and display a pineapple as the centerpiece, projecting a symbol of their wealth, hospitality, and status. Check it out in the FOHBC Virtual Museum Bitters Gallery. Historical text updated today with a few more visuals. Remember the pineapple girl from the 2019 FOHBC Augusta National? The “Tippecanoe” GVII-2 Figural Cabin “Tippecanoe” is a nickname for William Henry Harrison from his role in the Battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison was also the ninth president of the United States from March 1841 to April 1841. “Tippecanoe” is also embossed on one of the finest pieces of early American glass ever made. William Henry Harrison was born in Charles City County, Virginia, the son of … See and read more The GI-94 Franklin – Dyott historical flask Thomas W. Dyott, the self-proclaimed “king” of American patent medicine, was a great entrepreneur who took advantage of political events and slogans from the times and interpreted them onto his pictorial flasks. This was a clever marketing ploy that netted him great profits with his customer base and audience. This astute merchandising is very evident on our GI-94 flask as Dyott capitalized on the popularity of Benjamin Franklin. See and Read More Two fantastic Shriver’s Baltimore Oyster Ketchup bottles added to the Virtual Museum Oyster bars were popular establishments starting in the early to mid-1800s and could be found in eastern cities such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore that were close to the Atlantic oyster beds. The Dorlon & Shaffer Oyster House at Fulton Market in New York City was famous nationally and even internationally to travelers to the big city. The Union Oyster House in Boston is the oldest continuously open restaurant in the United States as it opened in 1826. Baltimore was the epicenter of seafood at that time with its proximity to the Chesapeake Bay. Visit the Food & Sauces Gallery and read all about it. American Life Bitters top bottle in the Glass Works Auction Premier Auction #143 Here is a really great looking rectangular figural bitters cabin with a curved roof rather than angular like most cabin bitters. The American Life Bitters is pretty tough to obtain and there are two variants. Our museum example is extremely rare and possibly unique in color. For the most part, this bottle story is about the inventor, Peter E. Iler, who was born in Wooster, Ohio in 1840. He eventually ended up in Omaha, Nebraska. His famous bitters have either the Tiffin, Ohio, or Omaha, Nebraska embossing. READ MORE A spectacular two-tone amber Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters Here is a spectacular example of a two-tone amber Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters from the Steven Hubbell collection. This new spinner was added to the existing page for the mint green Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters. Both examples are extraordinary and will stand together in the Bitters Gallery. Alan DeMaison really did a great job imaging this bottle. Louis Lacour was born on February 26, 1821, in Saint-Fargeau, Borough of Joigny, Departement of l’Yvonne, region of Burgundy, France which is about 120 miles southeast of Paris. Lacour left Paris in 1849, and came to California, via New York, as he had heard of the California gold rush. SEE BOTTLE AT & Co. – Asher Taylor & Co. We just added a great example of the unusual AT & Co (Asher Taylor & Co.) bottle to the FOHBC Virtual Museum Bitters Gallery. A good many of the AT & Co bottles were found at the legendary 1998 dig at an old 19th-century bottle recycling plant in San Francisco, California. Twenty-five to thirty of these bottles, in various conditions, were found in great-looking shades of amber, olive amber, yellow amber, and yellow-olive. At the same dig, many other western bitters were found in subterranean caches near the AT & Co bottles. READ MORE A fine Fautz’s Family Medicines – Baltimore from the Ben Swanson Collection S. A. Foutz is Solomon A. Foutz. In 1857 or so, Solomon went into business with his brother David E. Foutz as S. A. Foutz & Bro. in Baltimore and manufactured and extensively sold such remedies known as “Foutz’s Horse and Cattle Powders” and “Foutz’s Liniment”. In 1867 Solomon sold out to his brother for a considerable sum of money. David E. Foutz became sole owner of all of the secret formulas, names, good will, stock of goods, and materials connected with the business. David kept the S. A. Foutz & Bro. name and until his death in 1877. Business was later conducted by his widow which evolved into a Trade-Marks and Trade Names – Unlawful Competition lawsuit. READ MORE Arthur’s Patent 1855 – Arthur, Burnham & Gilroy Philadelphia Like carved ice, an extremely rare Arthur’s Patent 1855 – Arthur, Burnham & Gilroy Philadelphia clear pint now in the FOHBC Virtual Museum Jar Gallery. Alan DeMaison did an amazing job on the piece of clear glass. The most difficult to photograph. This is the second Dr. Robert Arthur piece in the museum. Both from the 1850s. SEE THE JAR The Wormser Bros San Francisco figural barrel – whiskey or bitters? Most antique bottle collectors believe that this figural barrel-shaped bottle was a bitters product. In most cases, if a proprietor had a liquor like bourbon or whiskey, he would use a traditional long neck round bottle in quarts and fifths and use a smaller pint and half-pint flask for lesser amounts. If a proprietor had a bitters to market, he might for example use a figural barrel, cabin, or square bottle. The irony is that these products, whether it was a whiskey or bitters, contained a large amount of alcohol. It is all about marketing and who you are selling to. Unfortunately, we have no advertising to confirm this bitters assertion though it is recorded that an example with a partial label was found in Nevada. We have not seen this example. READ MORE Sanded Patd Sept 25th 1877 Target Balls See a gorgeous deep teal, almost peacock blue target ball that is embossed PATD SEPT 25TH 1877 around the shoulder. Also a medium grass green example in a full rotation in the FOHBC Virtual Museum. These balls are 3-piece molds with an overall pebbly or sandy finish to the glass with a sheared mouth. These ‘sand balls’ are called just that because as they were cooling, they rolled the ball in very fine sand, which embedded into the glass, causing a more coarse surface. This allowed for better penetration of the ball by the shooter. The ball is 2 5/8″ in diameter and perfect. SEE THE TARGET BALLS A. Stone & Co. Cunninghams & Co. Philadelphia in olive green This is the earliest Stone Jar. Our quart A. Stone & Co. groove ring wax sealer jar in this beautiful olive green glass color is unique. The jar has a high kick-up, bare iron pontil scar. These rare jars are usually found in aqua and can also be found in half-gallons. Two California Wine Bitters now spinning in the FOHBC Virtual Museum California Wine Bitters is an extremely desirable, top-25 western bitters that is considered very rare. The round cylinder bottles are typically found in beautiful shades of green. A western collector once noted that of the ten or so examples he had either owned, handled, or seen, each was a different green color. Of the specimens that are known, the bottles have been found in the eastern and western United States. It was reported that a whole example was found at a mining camp near Desert Hills, Arizona, 35 miles from Apache Junction and one example came from an early river town in the Northern Sacramento Valley. Broken examples have been found in San Francisco and a few examples have even been found under buildings in New Hampshire. SEE EXAMPLES A. Stone & Co. Philada. wax sealer In aquamarine This early, small-mouth, quart wax sealer jar is embossed A. STONE & Co. in an arch on the face of the container. The ‘O’ in ‘Co.’ is smaller. Centered beneath, in a horizontal line, is PHILADA. The last ‘A’ is smaller. This same information is typically embossed on the glass stopper. The unusual narrow mouth glass stopper is typically found on their pint jars. The bottoms are usually unmarked and smooth. “All must surrender to Constitution Bitters” Here is an extraordinary rectangular Constitution Bitters in a medium pink amethyst or puce glass coloration. These bottles are typically found in shades of amber. This Constitution Bitters brand (there is another figural bottle with the same name), we are dealing with Stephen B. Seward and Burr S. Bentley of Seward & Bentley in Buffalo, New York. There are also listings for Seward, Bentley & Cheney, Ward & Bentley, and Daniel Seward & Co., that show obvious changes in partnership and ownership later in the 1860s. Stephen Seward even got his start earlier than that as his name occurs as S. B. Seward in the late 1850s on bottles and advertising etc. When this bottle mold was produced, Cheney had not yet joined the firm. READ & SEE MORE An Unusual Dark Teal Green Jar Free-blown means glass-forming by blowing and manipulating by hand and tools without the aid of a mold to shape the bottle. A free-blown bottle has no mold seams or other mold-induced markings. Our museum example represents a type of jar produced in the Pittsburgh District which typically comprises Louisville, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh geographic… Dorlon & Shaffer Pickled Oysters Back on the saddle so to speak. The FOHBC Virtual Museum site had more issues that started last Friday morning that prevented me from posting. Actually, four (4) web sites that I oversee went down during this period. FMG Design, Peachridge Glass, FOHBC, and the FOHBC Virtual Museum. Been a challenge, working with Miguel Ruiz to get back up in an environment where service has dropped or been prolonged due to the Coronavirus. I think layoffs are involved too. Anyway, here is a wonderful Dorlon & Shaffer Pickled Oysters jar with a story that I started last week and just completed. Would make a good story in Bottles and Extras. 2019 FOHBC 50th Anniversary National Antique Bottle Convention | Augusta, Georgia | Souvenir Program Well, the show is over and we are catching our breath. A couple of years of work boiling down to three or four intense days in Augusta. Now as the dust settles, we settle our accounts, collects some comments, look thru a couple thousand images and prepare for write-ups in Bottles and Extras and Antique Bottle & Glass Collector. A special shout-out to advertisers in our Souvenir Program. An important source of revenue and information. [Read] Pond’s Bitters “Makes You Go Some” Pond’s Bitters is named after George Morgan Pond who was born in Tareytown, New York on 29 May 1854. Tarrytown is a village in the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County, New York. It is located on the eastern bank of the Hudson River, about 25 miles north of midtown Manhattan in New York City. He was the son of Loyal Sylvester Pond (Vermont) and Harriet Sarah Taylor (New Hampshire). He later married Louise Fitch in 1882. Their children were Annie, Kate, George Jr., Guy and Rainsferd Pond. If you can’t do business, drink Rex Bitters – Chicago Here is what I call a telephone bitters. A bitters product so late that you could call your favorite saloon, liquor or drug store and order a case of Rex Bitters using your Chicago Telephone Company issued telephone, if you were fortunate enough to have one. Illinois Bell would not form until 1923 when they began automatic telephone service in Chicago. Jacob & David Hostetter – Dr. J. Hostetter’s Celebrated Stomach Bitters David Hostetter was a millionaire manufacturer of one of the most, if not the most famous and successful bitters ever produced, the Dr. J. Hostetter’s Celebrated Stomach Bitters. Much has been written about the brand. I thought I would try to tie it all together. Of Dutch extraction, David Hostetter was the eldest child of Jacob Hostetter by his wife Mary Landis, and was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on 23 January 1819. Dr. Jacob Hostetter was born on 13 October 1785 in York County, Pennsylvania… Bininger Gallery Update I have been nesting some great images of Bininger bottles for the past year or so waiting for a few missing pictures to justify a post gallery. With the Glass Works Auctions | Auction #96 additions, I can now release this post. If you have any additions of any different bottles, please send to me. My interest in Bininger’s started early with figural clock, cannon and barrel additions to go with my bitters collection. Many of us do this as the Bininger name means great bottles and history. Post Update with early use info: Log Cabin Series – Drake’s Plantation Bitters This medicinal make-up was unknown until the middle of the seventeenth century. The natives of Peru were generally supposed to have been long previously acquainted with its most wonderful medicinal qualities. Humbboldt makes favorable mention of the febrifuge qualities of this article as an antidote to Fever and Ague, Intermittent and Malarious Fevers, in his extensive South American travels. The Countess, wife of the Viceroy of Peru, having in her own person experienced the beneficial effects of the bark, is said, on her return to Spain … 4 Responses to Antique Bottle and Glass News Warren Friedrich says: 20 April 2011 at 6:13 pm I’ve just spent several hours perusing this website for Antique Bottle Collectors, I have to say this is the most comprehensive internet site ever developed for the antique bottle enthusiast.

Read More Dingen’s Napolean Cocktail Bitters Display One of the most interesting and visually exciting figural bitters bottles is Napolean Cocktail Bitters put out by the Dingens Brothers in Buffalo, New York. The banjo-lady’s leg form is unique for a bitters bottle and must have had a great shelf presence wherever it was sold be it in grocery stores or taverns. Bitters were being sold as medicines even though they were full of alcohol to avoid liquor taxes. These figural bottles further distanced the product from your typical whiskey bottle and made it more “acceptable” to buy with your weekly groceries. VISIT MUSEUM Three Great-Looking Dr. Wonser’s USA Bitters Squares After looking at the masterful mold design for Dr. Wonser’s U.S.A. Indian Root Bitters in a cylinder form (we have three examples in our museum), we now look at a square bottle embossed ‘DR. WONSER’S BITTERS’. The bottle also is embossed ‘USA’ on a second side panel. The third and fourth sides are blank and are where the label would have gone. The square bottle came after the cylinder bottle. The bottles are found in blue and green aquamarine. All are very lightly embossed. SEE MORE Elias Henry Van Benschoten and his Pickle Bottles Of Dutch stock, Elias Henry Van Benschoten was born in Beekman, Dutchess Co., New York on April 28, 1814 to Henry Teunise Van Benschoten (also spelled “Van Bunschoten” or “Van Bunschooten” and Mary Jackson. Elias would marry Phoebe Kissam Underhill and they had four children, William N., Mary E., Agusta, and John N. Van Benschoten. See the bottle and read more. Hexagonal Gothic Peppersauce Bottles Sauces and condiments for foods were marketed as a necessity prior to the food preservation advances of the 20th century. The foods available during the 18th and 19th centuries were often bland, of dubious quality and origin and effective date-stamping did not exist. This led the way for the preparation and use of a wide variety of sauces to either enhance the food flavor or cover up any off-flavors. See and Read About The legendary GII-57 “J.P.F. Eagle – Cornucopia “Conn” flask The GII-57 “J.P.F.” Eagle – Cornucopia and “Conn.” flask is a great rarity from an important Connecticut glass house. The flask is attributed to the Pitkin Glass Works from the Orford Parish of East Hartford, Connecticut. For most of its active existence, the Pitkin Glass Works was located in East Hartford until it became part of Manchester in 1823 when Manchester incorporated to become a separate town. The flask was made between 1815 and 1830. See and read all about this unique flask. Call For Historical Information The FOHBC, led by board member Michael Seeliger, has started a major new initiative to preserve our history. We would like your assistance in locating potentially long-lost images before it is too late as they could potentially be forgotten forever. We are looking for photographs, either in black and white or color of the great collections, collectors, bottle shows and displays of yesteryear. Our goal is to gather, enhance, and index this material digitally and make it available to our members and collectors for generations to come.

Carefully verified and cross-referenced with Bill Ham’s collected information and the Peachridge Glass database with 38,000 plus images and hundreds of files of obscure bitters. Lots of new bottles and information since 2004 when Bitters Bottle Supplement was published. Besides new and updated bottles and advertising, there are color plate sections on rare bitters, bitters facsimile bank notes, bitters postal covers, bitters almanacs, shell cards and tokens. For ephemera, the great museum-destined archives of Dan Cowman, Joe Gourd and Ben Swanson, among others, have been included. Additionally, the Index has been totally re-done to include all three books. Every documented bitters ever produced, and their makers have been indexed. This is a great tool! Thanks to Bill Ham, Joe Gourd, Ben Swanson and Jeff Burkhardt for their contributions. Research, design, and book layout by Ferdinand Meyer V. Every bottle has a story! INFO Pineapple Bitters One of my favorite bottles is the Pineapple Bitters. Affluent colonists would throw dinner parties and display a pineapple as the centerpiece, projecting a symbol of their wealth, hospitality, and status. Check it out in the FOHBC Virtual Museum Bitters Gallery. Historical text updated today with a few more visuals. Remember the pineapple girl from the 2019 FOHBC Augusta National? The “Tippecanoe” GVII-2 Figural Cabin “Tippecanoe” is a nickname for William Henry Harrison from his role in the Battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison was also the ninth president of the United States from March 1841 to April 1841. “Tippecanoe” is also embossed on one of the finest pieces of early American glass ever made. William Henry Harrison was born in Charles City County, Virginia, the son of … See and read more The GI-94 Franklin – Dyott historical flask Thomas W. Dyott, the self-proclaimed “king” of American patent medicine, was a great entrepreneur who took advantage of political events and slogans from the times and interpreted them onto his pictorial flasks. This was a clever marketing ploy that netted him great profits with his customer base and audience. This astute merchandising is very evident on our GI-94 flask as Dyott capitalized on the popularity of Benjamin Franklin. See and Read More Two fantastic Shriver’s Baltimore Oyster Ketchup bottles added to the Virtual Museum Oyster bars were popular establishments starting in the early to mid-1800s and could be found in eastern cities such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore that were close to the Atlantic oyster beds. The Dorlon & Shaffer Oyster House at Fulton Market in New York City was famous nationally and even internationally to travelers to the big city. The Union Oyster House in Boston is the oldest continuously open restaurant in the United States as it opened in 1826. Baltimore was the epicenter of seafood at that time with its proximity to the Chesapeake Bay. Visit the Food & Sauces Gallery and read all about it. American Life Bitters top bottle in the Glass Works Auction Premier Auction #143 Here is a really great looking rectangular figural bitters cabin with a curved roof rather than angular like most cabin bitters. The American Life Bitters is pretty tough to obtain and there are two variants. Our museum example is extremely rare and possibly unique in color. For the most part, this bottle story is about the inventor, Peter E. Iler, who was born in Wooster, Ohio in 1840. He eventually ended up in Omaha, Nebraska. His famous bitters have either the Tiffin, Ohio, or Omaha, Nebraska embossing. READ MORE A spectacular two-tone amber Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters Here is a spectacular example of a two-tone amber Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters from the Steven Hubbell collection. This new spinner was added to the existing page for the mint green Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters. Both examples are extraordinary and will stand together in the Bitters Gallery. Alan DeMaison really did a great job imaging this bottle. Louis Lacour was born on February 26, 1821, in Saint-Fargeau, Borough of Joigny, Departement of l’Yvonne, region of Burgundy, France which is about 120 miles southeast of Paris. Lacour left Paris in 1849, and came to California, via New York, as he had heard of the California gold rush. SEE BOTTLE AT & Co. – Asher Taylor & Co. We just added a great example of the unusual AT & Co (Asher Taylor & Co.) bottle to the FOHBC Virtual Museum Bitters Gallery. A good many of the AT & Co bottles were found at the legendary 1998 dig at an old 19th-century bottle recycling plant in San Francisco, California. Twenty-five to thirty of these bottles, in various conditions, were found in great-looking shades of amber, olive amber, yellow amber, and yellow-olive. At the same dig, many other western bitters were found in subterranean caches near the AT & Co bottles. READ MORE A fine Fautz’s Family Medicines – Baltimore from the Ben Swanson Collection S. A. Foutz is Solomon A. Foutz. In 1857 or so, Solomon went into business with his brother David E. Foutz as S. A. Foutz & Bro. in Baltimore and manufactured and extensively sold such remedies known as “Foutz’s Horse and Cattle Powders” and “Foutz’s Liniment”. In 1867 Solomon sold out to his brother for a considerable sum of money. David E. Foutz became sole owner of all of the secret formulas, names, good will, stock of goods, and materials connected with the business. David kept the S. A. Foutz & Bro. name and until his death in 1877. Business was later conducted by his widow which evolved into a Trade-Marks and Trade Names – Unlawful Competition lawsuit. READ MORE Arthur’s Patent 1855 – Arthur, Burnham & Gilroy Philadelphia Like carved ice, an extremely rare Arthur’s Patent 1855 – Arthur, Burnham & Gilroy Philadelphia clear pint now in the FOHBC Virtual Museum Jar Gallery. Alan DeMaison did an amazing job on the piece of clear glass. The most difficult to photograph. This is the second Dr. Robert Arthur piece in the museum. Both from the 1850s. SEE THE JAR The Wormser Bros San Francisco figural barrel – whiskey or bitters? Most antique bottle collectors believe that this figural barrel-shaped bottle was a bitters product. In most cases, if a proprietor had a liquor like bourbon or whiskey, he would use a traditional long neck round bottle in quarts and fifths and use a smaller pint and half-pint flask for lesser amounts. If a proprietor had a bitters to market, he might for example use a figural barrel, cabin, or square bottle. The irony is that these products, whether it was a whiskey or bitters, contained a large amount of alcohol. It is all about marketing and who you are selling to. Unfortunately, we have no advertising to confirm this bitters assertion though it is recorded that an example with a partial label was found in Nevada. We have not seen this example. READ MORE Sanded Patd Sept 25th 1877 Target Balls See a gorgeous deep teal, almost peacock blue target ball that is embossed PATD SEPT 25TH 1877 around the shoulder. Also a medium grass green example in a full rotation in the FOHBC Virtual Museum. These balls are 3-piece molds with an overall pebbly or sandy finish to the glass with a sheared mouth. These ‘sand balls’ are called just that because as they were cooling, they rolled the ball in very fine sand, which embedded into the glass, causing a more coarse surface. This allowed for better penetration of the ball by the shooter. The ball is 2 5/8″ in diameter and perfect. SEE THE TARGET BALLS A. Stone & Co. Cunninghams & Co. Philadelphia in olive green This is the earliest Stone Jar. Our quart A. Stone & Co. groove ring wax sealer jar in this beautiful olive green glass color is unique. The jar has a high kick-up, bare iron pontil scar. These rare jars are usually found in aqua and can also be found in half-gallons. Two California Wine Bitters now spinning in the FOHBC Virtual Museum California Wine Bitters is an extremely desirable, top-25 western bitters that is considered very rare. The round cylinder bottles are typically found in beautiful shades of green. A western collector once noted that of the ten or so examples he had either owned, handled, or seen, each was a different green color. Of the specimens that are known, the bottles have been found in the eastern and western United States. It was reported that a whole example was found at a mining camp near Desert Hills, Arizona, 35 miles from Apache Junction and one example came from an early river town in the Northern Sacramento Valley. Broken examples have been found in San Francisco and a few examples have even been found under buildings in New Hampshire. SEE EXAMPLES A. Stone & Co. Philada. wax sealer In aquamarine This early, small-mouth, quart wax sealer jar is embossed A. STONE & Co. in an arch on the face of the container. The ‘O’ in ‘Co.’ is smaller. Centered beneath, in a horizontal line, is PHILADA. The last ‘A’ is smaller. This same information is typically embossed on the glass stopper. The unusual narrow mouth glass stopper is typically found on their pint jars. The bottoms are usually unmarked and smooth. “All must surrender to Constitution Bitters” Here is an extraordinary rectangular Constitution Bitters in a medium pink amethyst or puce glass coloration. These bottles are typically found in shades of amber. This Constitution Bitters brand (there is another figural bottle with the same name), we are dealing with Stephen B. Seward and Burr S. Bentley of Seward & Bentley in Buffalo, New York. There are also listings for Seward, Bentley & Cheney, Ward & Bentley, and Daniel Seward & Co., that show obvious changes in partnership and ownership later in the 1860s. Stephen Seward even got his start earlier than that as his name occurs as S. B. Seward in the late 1850s on bottles and advertising etc. When this bottle mold was produced, Cheney had not yet joined the firm. READ & SEE MORE An Unusual Dark Teal Green Jar Free-blown means glass-forming by blowing and manipulating by hand and tools without the aid of a mold to shape the bottle.

The FOHBC Virtual Museum site had more issues that started last Friday morning that prevented me from posting. Actually, four (4) web sites that I oversee went down during this period. FMG Design, Peachridge Glass, FOHBC, and the FOHBC Virtual Museum. Been a challenge, working with Miguel Ruiz to get back up in an environment where service has dropped or been prolonged due to the Coronavirus. I think layoffs are involved too. Anyway, here is a wonderful Dorlon & Shaffer Pickled Oysters jar with a story that I started last week and just completed. Would make a good story in Bottles and Extras. 2019 FOHBC 50th Anniversary National Antique Bottle Convention | Augusta, Georgia | Souvenir Program Well, the show is over and we are catching our breath. A couple of years of work boiling down to three or four intense days in Augusta.

A special shout-out to advertisers in our Souvenir Program. An important source of revenue and information. [Read] Pond’s Bitters “Makes You Go Some” Pond’s Bitters is named after George Morgan Pond who was born in Tareytown, New York on 29 May 1854. Tarrytown is a village in the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County, New York. It is located on the eastern bank of the Hudson River, about 25 miles north of midtown Manhattan in New York City. He was the son of Loyal Sylvester Pond (Vermont) and Harriet Sarah Taylor (New Hampshire). He later married Louise Fitch in 1882. Their children were Annie, Kate, George Jr., Guy and Rainsferd Pond. If you can’t do business, drink Rex Bitters – Chicago Here is what I call a telephone bitters. A bitters product so late that you could call your favorite saloon, liquor or drug store and order a case of Rex Bitters using your Chicago Telephone Company issued telephone, if you were fortunate enough to have one. Illinois Bell would not form until 1923 when they began automatic telephone service in Chicago. Jacob & David Hostetter – Dr. J. Hostetter’s Celebrated Stomach Bitters David Hostetter was a millionaire manufacturer of one of the most, if not the most famous and successful bitters ever produced, the Dr. J. Hostetter’s Celebrated Stomach Bitters. Much has been written about the brand. I thought I would try to tie it all together. Of Dutch extraction, David Hostetter was the eldest child of Jacob Hostetter by his wife Mary Landis, and was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on 23 January 1819. Dr. Jacob Hostetter was born on 13 October 1785 in York County, Pennsylvania… Bininger Gallery Update I have been nesting some great images of Bininger bottles for the past year or so waiting for a few missing pictures to justify a post gallery. With the Glass Works Auctions | Auction #96 additions, I can now release this post. If you have any additions of any different bottles, please send to me. My interest in Bininger’s started early with figural clock, cannon and barrel additions to go with my bitters collection. Many of us do this as the Bininger name means great bottles and history. Post Update with early use info: Log Cabin Series – Drake’s Plantation Bitters This medicinal make-up was unknown until the middle of the seventeenth century.

This was a clever marketing ploy that netted him great profits with his customer base and audience. This astute merchandising is very evident on our GI-94 flask as Dyott capitalized on the popularity of Benjamin Franklin. See and Read More Two fantastic Shriver’s Baltimore Oyster Ketchup bottles added to the Virtual Museum Oyster bars were popular establishments starting in the early to mid-1800s and could be found in eastern cities such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore that were close to the Atlantic oyster beds. The Dorlon & Shaffer Oyster House at Fulton Market in New York City was famous nationally and even internationally to travelers to the big city. The Union Oyster House in Boston is the oldest continuously open restaurant in the United States as it opened in 1826. Baltimore was the epicenter of seafood at that time with its proximity to the Chesapeake Bay. Visit the Food & Sauces Gallery and read all about it. American Life Bitters top bottle in the Glass Works Auction Premier Auction #143 Here is a really great looking rectangular figural bitters cabin with a curved roof rather than angular like most cabin bitters. The American Life Bitters is pretty tough to obtain and there are two variants. Our museum example is extremely rare and possibly unique in color. For the most part, this bottle story is about the inventor, Peter E. Iler, who was born in Wooster, Ohio in 1840. He eventually ended up in Omaha, Nebraska. His famous bitters have either the Tiffin, Ohio, or Omaha, Nebraska embossing. READ MORE A spectacular two-tone amber Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters Here is a spectacular example of a two-tone amber Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters from the Steven Hubbell collection. This new spinner was added to the existing page for the mint green Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters. Both examples are extraordinary and will stand together in the Bitters Gallery. Alan DeMaison really did a great job imaging this bottle. Louis Lacour was born on February 26, 1821, in Saint-Fargeau, Borough of Joigny, Departement of l’Yvonne, region of Burgundy, France which is about 120 miles southeast of Paris. Lacour left Paris in 1849, and came to California, via New York, as he had heard of the California gold rush. SEE BOTTLE AT & Co. – Asher Taylor & Co. We just added a great example of the unusual AT & Co (Asher Taylor & Co.) bottle to the FOHBC Virtual Museum Bitters Gallery. A good many of the AT & Co bottles were found at the legendary 1998 dig at an old 19th-century bottle recycling plant in San Francisco, California. Twenty-five to thirty of these bottles, in various conditions, were found in great-looking shades of amber, olive amber, yellow amber, and yellow-olive. At the same dig, many other western bitters were found in subterranean caches near the AT & Co bottles. READ MORE A fine Fautz’s Family Medicines – Baltimore from the Ben Swanson Collection S. A. Foutz is Solomon A. Foutz. In 1857 or so, Solomon went into business with his brother David E. Foutz as S. A. Foutz & Bro. in Baltimore and manufactured and extensively sold such remedies known as “Foutz’s Horse and Cattle Powders” and “Foutz’s Liniment”. In 1867 Solomon sold out to his brother for a considerable sum of money. David E. Foutz became sole owner of all of the secret formulas, names, good will, stock of goods, and materials connected with the business. David kept the S. A. Foutz & Bro. name and until his death in 1877. Business was later conducted by his widow which evolved into a Trade-Marks and Trade Names – Unlawful Competition lawsuit.

Alan DeMaison did an amazing job on the piece of clear glass. The most difficult to photograph. This is the second Dr. Robert Arthur piece in the museum. Both from the 1850s. SEE THE JAR The Wormser Bros San Francisco figural barrel – whiskey or bitters? Most antique bottle collectors believe that this figural barrel-shaped bottle was a bitters product. In most cases, if a proprietor had a liquor like bourbon or whiskey, he would use a traditional long neck round bottle in quarts and fifths and use a smaller pint and half-pint flask for lesser amounts. If a proprietor had a bitters to market, he might for example use a figural barrel, cabin, or square bottle. The irony is that these products, whether it was a whiskey or bitters, contained a large amount of alcohol. It is all about marketing and who you are selling to. Unfortunately, we have no advertising to confirm this bitters assertion though it is recorded that an example with a partial label was found in Nevada. We have not seen this example.

Also a medium grass green example in a full rotation in the FOHBC Virtual Museum. These balls are 3-piece molds with an overall pebbly or sandy finish to the glass with a sheared mouth. These ‘sand balls’ are called just that because as they were cooling, they rolled the ball in very fine sand, which embedded into the glass, causing a more coarse surface. This allowed for better penetration of the ball by the shooter. The ball is 2 5/8″ in diameter and perfect. SEE THE TARGET BALLS A. Stone & Co. Cunninghams & Co. Philadelphia in olive green This is the earliest Stone Jar. Our quart A. Stone & Co. groove ring wax sealer jar in this beautiful olive green glass color is unique. The jar has a high kick-up, bare iron pontil scar. These rare jars are usually found in aqua and can also be found in half-gallons. Two California Wine Bitters now spinning in the FOHBC Virtual Museum California Wine Bitters is an extremely desirable, top-25 western bitters that is considered very rare. The round cylinder bottles are typically found in beautiful shades of green. A western collector once noted that of the ten or so examples he had either owned, handled, or seen, each was a different green color. Of the specimens that are known, the bottles have been found in the eastern and western United States. It was reported that a whole example was found at a mining camp near Desert Hills, Arizona, 35 miles from Apache Junction and one example came from an early river town in the Northern Sacramento Valley. Broken examples have been found in San Francisco and a few examples have even been found under buildings in New Hampshire. SEE EXAMPLES A. Stone & Co. Philada. wax sealer In aquamarine This early, small-mouth, quart wax sealer jar is embossed A. STONE & Co. in an arch on the face of the container. The ‘O’ in ‘Co.’ is smaller. Centered beneath, in a horizontal line, is PHILADA. The last ‘A’ is smaller. This same information is typically embossed on the glass stopper. The unusual narrow mouth glass stopper is typically found on their pint jars. The bottoms are usually unmarked and smooth. “All must surrender to Constitution Bitters” Here is an extraordinary rectangular Constitution Bitters in a medium pink amethyst or puce glass coloration. These bottles are typically found in shades of amber. This Constitution Bitters brand (there is another figural bottle with the same name), we are dealing with Stephen B. Seward and Burr S. Bentley of Seward & Bentley in Buffalo, New York. There are also listings for Seward, Bentley & Cheney, Ward & Bentley, and Daniel Seward & Co., that show obvious changes in partnership and ownership later in the 1860s. Stephen Seward even got his start earlier than that as his name occurs as S. B. Seward in the late 1850s on bottles and advertising etc. When this bottle mold was produced, Cheney had not yet joined the firm.

Hostetter’s Celebrated Stomach Bitters David Hostetter was a millionaire manufacturer of one of the most, if not the most famous and successful bitters ever produced, the Dr. J. Hostetter’s Celebrated Stomach Bitters. Much has been written about the brand. I thought I would try to tie it all together. Of Dutch extraction, David Hostetter was the eldest child of Jacob Hostetter by his wife Mary Landis, and was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on 23 January 1819. Dr. Jacob Hostetter was born on 13 October 1785 in York County, Pennsylvania… Bininger Gallery Update I have been nesting some great images of Bininger bottles for the past year or so waiting for a few missing pictures to justify a post gallery.

Hexagonal Gothic Peppersauce Bottles Sauces and condiments for foods were marketed as a necessity prior to the food preservation advances of the 20th century. The foods available during the 18th and 19th centuries were often bland, of dubious quality and origin and effective date-stamping did not exist. This led the way for the preparation and use of a wide variety of sauces to either enhance the food flavor or cover up any off-flavors. See and Read About The legendary GII-57 “J.P.F.

Hexagonal Gothic Peppersauce Bottles Sauces and condiments for foods were marketed as a necessity prior to the food preservation advances of the 20th century. The foods available during the 18th and 19th centuries were often bland, of dubious quality and origin and effective date-stamping did not exist. This led the way for the preparation and use of a wide variety of sauces to either enhance the food flavor or cover up any off-flavors. See and Read About The legendary GII-57 “J.P.F. Eagle – Cornucopia “Conn” flask The GII-57 “J.P.F.” Eagle – Cornucopia and “Conn.” flask is a great rarity from an important Connecticut glass house. The flask is attributed to the Pitkin Glass Works from the Orford Parish of East Hartford, Connecticut. For most of its active existence, the Pitkin Glass Works was located in East Hartford until it became part of Manchester in 1823 when Manchester incorporated to become a separate town. The flask was made between 1815 and 1830. See and read all about this unique flask. Call For Historical Information The FOHBC, led by board member Michael Seeliger, has started a major new initiative to preserve our history. We would like your assistance in locating potentially long-lost images before it is too late as they could potentially be forgotten forever. We are looking for photographs, either in black and white or color of the great collections, collectors, bottle shows and displays of yesteryear. Our goal is to gather, enhance, and index this material digitally and make it available to our members and collectors for generations to come. More Info Bitters Bottles Supplement 2 Update – Available for Ordering! This monumental effort culminates a massive amount of work over many years. Carefully verified and cross-referenced with Bill Ham’s collected information and the Peachridge Glass database with 38,000 plus images and hundreds of files of obscure bitters. Lots of new bottles and information since 2004 when Bitters Bottle Supplement was published. Besides new and updated bottles and advertising, there are color plate sections on rare bitters, bitters facsimile bank notes, bitters postal covers, bitters almanacs, shell cards and tokens. For ephemera, the great museum-destined archives of Dan Cowman, Joe Gourd and Ben Swanson, among others, have been included. Additionally, the Index has been totally re-done to include all three books. Every documented bitters ever produced, and their makers have been indexed. This is a great tool! Thanks to Bill Ham, Joe Gourd, Ben Swanson and Jeff Burkhardt for their contributions. Research, design, and book layout by Ferdinand Meyer V. Every bottle has a story! INFO Pineapple Bitters One of my favorite bottles is the Pineapple Bitters. Affluent colonists would throw dinner parties and display a pineapple as the centerpiece, projecting a symbol of their wealth, hospitality, and status. Check it out in the FOHBC Virtual Museum Bitters Gallery. Historical text updated today with a few more visuals. Remember the pineapple girl from the 2019 FOHBC Augusta National? The “Tippecanoe” GVII-2 Figural Cabin “Tippecanoe” is a nickname for William Henry Harrison from his role in the Battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison was also the ninth president of the United States from March 1841 to April 1841. “Tippecanoe” is also embossed on one of the finest pieces of early American glass ever made. William Henry Harrison was born in Charles City County, Virginia, the son of … See and read more The GI-94 Franklin – Dyott historical flask Thomas W. Dyott, the self-proclaimed “king” of American patent medicine, was a great entrepreneur who took advantage of political events and slogans from the times and interpreted them onto his pictorial flasks. This was a clever marketing ploy that netted him great profits with his customer base and audience. This astute merchandising is very evident on our GI-94 flask as Dyott capitalized on the popularity of Benjamin Franklin. See and Read More Two fantastic Shriver’s Baltimore Oyster Ketchup bottles added to the Virtual Museum Oyster bars were popular establishments starting in the early to mid-1800s and could be found in eastern cities such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore that were close to the Atlantic oyster beds. The Dorlon & Shaffer Oyster House at Fulton Market in New York City was famous nationally and even internationally to travelers to the big city. The Union Oyster House in Boston is the oldest continuously open restaurant in the United States as it opened in 1826. Baltimore was the epicenter of seafood at that time with its proximity to the Chesapeake Bay. Visit the Food & Sauces Gallery and read all about it. American Life Bitters top bottle in the Glass Works Auction Premier Auction #143 Here is a really great looking rectangular figural bitters cabin with a curved roof rather than angular like most cabin bitters. The American Life Bitters is pretty tough to obtain and there are two variants. Our museum example is extremely rare and possibly unique in color. For the most part, this bottle story is about the inventor, Peter E. Iler, who was born in Wooster, Ohio in 1840. He eventually ended up in Omaha, Nebraska. His famous bitters have either the Tiffin, Ohio, or Omaha, Nebraska embossing. READ MORE A spectacular two-tone amber Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters Here is a spectacular example of a two-tone amber Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters from the Steven Hubbell collection. This new spinner was added to the existing page for the mint green Lacour’s Sarsapariphere Bitters. Both examples are extraordinary and will stand together in the Bitters Gallery. Alan DeMaison really did a great job imaging this bottle. Louis Lacour was born on February 26, 1821, in Saint-Fargeau, Borough of Joigny, Departement of l’Yvonne, region of Burgundy, France which is about 120 miles southeast of Paris. Lacour left Paris in 1849, and came to California, via New York, as he had heard of the California gold rush. SEE BOTTLE AT & Co. – Asher Taylor & Co. We just added a great example of the unusual AT & Co (Asher Taylor & Co.) bottle to the FOHBC Virtual Museum Bitters Gallery. A good many of the AT & Co bottles were found at the legendary 1998 dig at an old 19th-century bottle recycling plant in San Francisco, California. Twenty-five to thirty of these bottles, in various conditions, were found in great-looking shades of amber, olive amber, yellow amber, and yellow-olive. At the same dig, many other western bitters were found in subterranean caches near the AT & Co bottles. READ MORE A fine Fautz’s Family Medicines – Baltimore from the Ben Swanson Collection S. A. Foutz is Solomon A. Foutz. In 1857 or so, Solomon went into business with his brother David E. Foutz as S. A. Foutz & Bro. in Baltimore and manufactured and extensively sold such remedies known as “Foutz’s Horse and Cattle Powders” and “Foutz’s Liniment”. In 1867 Solomon sold out to his brother for a considerable sum of money. David E. Foutz became sole owner of all of the secret formulas, names, good will, stock of goods, and materials connected with the business. David kept the S. A. Foutz & Bro. name and until his death in 1877. Business was later conducted by his widow which evolved into a Trade-Marks and Trade Names – Unlawful Competition lawsuit. READ MORE Arthur’s Patent 1855 – Arthur, Burnham & Gilroy Philadelphia Like carved ice, an extremely rare Arthur’s Patent 1855 – Arthur, Burnham & Gilroy Philadelphia clear pint now in the FOHBC Virtual Museum Jar Gallery. Alan DeMaison did an amazing job on the piece of clear glass. The most difficult to photograph. This is the second Dr. Robert Arthur piece in the museum. Both from the 1850s. SEE THE JAR The Wormser Bros San Francisco figural barrel – whiskey or bitters? Most antique bottle collectors believe that this figural barrel-shaped bottle was a bitters product. In most cases, if a proprietor had a liquor like bourbon or whiskey, he would use a traditional long neck round bottle in quarts and fifths and use a smaller pint and half-pint flask for lesser amounts. If a proprietor had a bitters to market, he might for example use a figural barrel, cabin, or square bottle. The irony is that these products, whether it was a whiskey or bitters, contained a large amount of alcohol. It is all about marketing and who you are selling to. Unfortunately, we have no advertising to confirm this bitters assertion though it is recorded that an example with a partial label was found in Nevada. We have not seen this example. READ MORE Sanded Patd Sept 25th 1877 Target Balls See a gorgeous deep teal, almost peacock blue target ball that is embossed PATD SEPT 25TH 1877 around the shoulder. Also a medium grass green example in a full rotation in the FOHBC Virtual Museum. These balls are 3-piece molds with an overall pebbly or sandy finish to the glass with a sheared mouth. These ‘sand balls’ are called just that because as they were cooling, they rolled the ball in very fine sand, which embedded into the glass, causing a more coarse surface. This allowed for better penetration of the ball by the shooter. The ball is 2 5/8″ in diameter and perfect. SEE THE TARGET BALLS A. Stone & Co. Cunninghams & Co. Philadelphia in olive green This is the earliest Stone Jar. Our quart A. Stone & Co. groove ring wax sealer jar in this beautiful olive green glass color is unique. The jar has a high kick-up, bare iron pontil scar. These rare jars are usually found in aqua and can also be found in half-gallons. Two California Wine Bitters now spinning in the FOHBC Virtual Museum California Wine Bitters is an extremely desirable, top-25 western bitters that is considered very rare. The round cylinder bottles are typically found in beautiful shades of green. A western collector once noted that of the ten or so examples he had either owned, handled, or seen, each was a different green color. Of the specimens that are known, the bottles have been found in the eastern and western United States. It was reported that a whole example was found at a mining camp near Desert Hills, Arizona, 35 miles from Apache Junction and one example came from an early river town in the Northern Sacramento Valley. Broken examples have been found in San Francisco and a few examples have even been found under buildings in New Hampshire. SEE EXAMPLES A. Stone & Co. Philada. wax sealer In aquamarine This early, small-mouth, quart wax sealer jar is embossed A. STONE & Co. in an arch on the face of the container. The ‘O’ in ‘Co.’ is smaller. Centered beneath, in a horizontal line, is PHILADA. The last ‘A’ is smaller. This same information is typically embossed on the glass stopper. The unusual narrow mouth glass stopper is typically found on their pint jars. The bottoms are usually unmarked and smooth. “All must surrender to Constitution Bitters” Here is an extraordinary rectangular Constitution Bitters in a medium pink amethyst or puce glass coloration. These bottles are typically found in shades of amber. This Constitution Bitters brand (there is another figural bottle with the same name), we are dealing with Stephen B. Seward and Burr S. Bentley of Seward & Bentley in Buffalo, New York. There are also listings for Seward, Bentley & Cheney, Ward & Bentley, and Daniel Seward & Co., that show obvious changes in partnership and ownership later in the 1860s. Stephen Seward even got his start earlier than that as his name occurs as S. B. Seward in the late 1850s on bottles and advertising etc. When this bottle mold was produced, Cheney had not yet joined the firm. READ & SEE MORE An Unusual Dark Teal Green Jar Free-blown means glass-forming by blowing and manipulating by hand and tools without the aid of a mold to shape the bottle. A free-blown bottle has no mold seams or other mold-induced markings. Our museum example represents a type of jar produced in the Pittsburgh District which typically comprises Louisville, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh geographic… Dorlon & Shaffer Pickled Oysters Back on the saddle so to speak. The FOHBC Virtual Museum site had more issues that started last Friday morning that prevented me from posting. Actually, four (4) web sites that I oversee went down during this period. FMG Design, Peachridge Glass, FOHBC, and the FOHBC Virtual Museum. Been a challenge, working with Miguel Ruiz to get back up in an environment where service has dropped or been prolonged due to the Coronavirus. I think layoffs are involved too. Anyway, here is a wonderful Dorlon & Shaffer Pickled Oysters jar with a story that I started last week and just completed. Would make a good story in Bottles and Extras. 2019 FOHBC 50th Anniversary National Antique Bottle Convention | Augusta, Georgia | Souvenir Program Well, the show is over and we are catching our breath.

[Read] Pond’s Bitters “Makes You Go Some” Pond’s Bitters is named after George Morgan Pond who was born in Tareytown, New York on 29 May 1854. Tarrytown is a village in the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County, New York. It is located on the eastern bank of the Hudson River, about 25 miles north of midtown Manhattan in New York City. He was the son of Loyal Sylvester Pond (Vermont) and Harriet Sarah Taylor (New Hampshire). He later married Louise Fitch in 1882. Their children were Annie, Kate, George Jr., Guy and Rainsferd Pond. If you can’t do business, drink Rex Bitters – Chicago Here is what I call a telephone bitters. A bitters product so late that you could call your favorite saloon, liquor or drug store and order a case of Rex Bitters using your Chicago Telephone Company issued telephone, if you were fortunate enough to have one. Illinois Bell would not form until 1923 when they began automatic telephone service in Chicago. Jacob & David Hostetter – Dr. J. Hostetter’s Celebrated Stomach Bitters David Hostetter was a millionaire manufacturer of one of the most, if not the most famous and successful bitters ever produced, the Dr. J. Hostetter’s Celebrated Stomach Bitters. Much has been written about the brand. I thought I would try to tie it all together. Of Dutch extraction, David Hostetter was the eldest child of Jacob Hostetter by his wife Mary Landis, and was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on 23 January 1819. Dr. Jacob Hostetter was born on 13 October 1785 in York County, Pennsylvania… Bininger Gallery Update I have been nesting some great images of Bininger bottles for the past year or so waiting for a few missing pictures to justify a post gallery. With the Glass Works Auctions | Auction #96 additions, I can now release this post. If you have any additions of any different bottles, please send to me. My interest in Bininger’s started early with figural clock, cannon and barrel additions to go with my bitters collection. Many of us do this as the Bininger name means great bottles and history. Post Update with early use info: Log Cabin Series – Drake’s Plantation Bitters This medicinal make-up was unknown until the middle of the seventeenth century.

Because that’s what we consider fun. And what makes for a mighty fine drink. OUR STORY OUR SPIRITS CRAFTED THE RIGHT WAY – FROM GRAIN TO GLASS A lot of folks love to apply the term “craft” to just anything these days, but here in Palisade it’s a way of life. From fruit to glass, every spirit we make is hand-crafted right here in Palisade. And not the easy way either. The way nobody would do it if they didn’t have to. We start with local fruits and grains raised by some of the most devoted growers on the planet, often upcycling local fruits that some foolishly deem “too ripe” for market. Our Christian Carl still delivers maximum flavor and high proof in a single distillation, and barrels bring out the unique colors and flavors in each of our spirits. We could go on for days about how proud we are of our spirits, how much love, grit and moxie goes into each one, but one sip will tell you more than we ever could so we’d say it’s best to start there.

Because that’s what we consider fun. And what makes for a mighty fine drink. OUR STORY OUR SPIRITS CRAFTED THE RIGHT WAY – FROM GRAIN TO GLASS A lot of folks love to apply the term “craft” to just anything these days, but here in Palisade it’s a way of life. From fruit to glass, every spirit we make is hand-crafted right here in Palisade. And not the easy way either. The way nobody would do it if they didn’t have to. We start with local fruits and grains raised by some of the most devoted growers on the planet, often upcycling local fruits that some foolishly deem “too ripe” for market. Our Christian Carl still delivers maximum flavor and high proof in a single distillation, and barrels bring out the unique colors and flavors in each of our spirits. We could go on for days about how proud we are of our spirits, how much love, grit and moxie goes into each one, but one sip will tell you more than we ever could so we’d say it’s best to start there.

Commercial Patio Shades, Glenn Hotel – Atlanta, GA Peachtree Blinds Focus: Window Coverings & Child Safety Window cords can pose a potential strangulation hazard to young children. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, corded window coverings are among the top five hidden hazards in American homes. Check your window coverings for exposed or dangling cords and retrofit or replace them with today’s safer products. Peachtree Blinds of Atlanta recommends using only cordless window coverings in homes with young children. Read More about Window Covering Safety for Children Security Films Help Buy Time To Respond Security window film retro-fits should be considered as part of any safety plan where ‘forced entry’ mitigation is identified as a priority. Installed properly on existing glass, security window film impedes entry into a building, home or storefront through windows and doors providing for enhanced reaction times. “Buying time” with secured glass leads directly to increased occupant safety and reduced loss of inventory & critical assets. In general, ‘safety’ or ‘security’ films are constructed with tough layers of high-grade polyester creating a thick laminate of 4 to 14 mils. The films are installed on the interior surface of existing glass and adhered with a strong, glue-like backing. The film application process is similar to the mechanics of wallpapering, but on glass surfaces. The films are installed using a water and soap solution – not a paste – and take up to 30-60 days to fully cure before dry. It is important to note security window films will not strengthen, keep from breaking or make glass ‘bullet proof‘. The best way to describe the performance of installed security window films is to compare the results to the performance of a broken windshield after a car collision. Upon impact, the glass will break, but the shards of glass are kept together through the lamination process – often times held in place – protecting occupants from glass fragmentation.

According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, corded window coverings are among the top five hidden hazards in American homes. Check your window coverings for exposed or dangling cords and retrofit or replace them with today’s safer products. Peachtree Blinds of Atlanta recommends using only cordless window coverings in homes with young children. Read More about Window Covering Safety for Children Security Films Help Buy Time To Respond Security window film retro-fits should be considered as part of any safety plan where ‘forced entry’ mitigation is identified as a priority. Installed properly on existing glass, security window film impedes entry into a building, home or storefront through windows and doors providing for enhanced reaction times. “Buying time” with secured glass leads directly to increased occupant safety and reduced loss of inventory & critical assets. In general, ‘safety’ or ‘security’ films are constructed with tough layers of high-grade polyester creating a thick laminate of 4 to 14 mils. The films are installed on the interior surface of existing glass and adhered with a strong, glue-like backing. The film application process is similar to the mechanics of wallpapering, but on glass surfaces. The films are installed using a water and soap solution – not a paste – and take up to 30-60 days to fully cure before dry. It is important to note security window films will not strengthen, keep from breaking or make glass ‘bullet proof‘. The best way to describe the performance of installed security window films is to compare the results to the performance of a broken windshield after a car collision. Upon impact, the glass will break, but the shards of glass are kept together through the lamination process – often times held in place – protecting occupants from glass fragmentation.

Installed properly on existing glass, security window film impedes entry into a building, home or storefront through windows and doors providing for enhanced reaction times. “Buying time” with secured glass leads directly to increased occupant safety and reduced loss of inventory & critical assets. In general, ‘safety’ or ‘security’ films are constructed with tough layers of high-grade polyester creating a thick laminate of 4 to 14 mils. The films are installed on the interior surface of existing glass and adhered with a strong, glue-like backing. The film application process is similar to the mechanics of wallpapering, but on glass surfaces. The films are installed using a water and soap solution – not a paste – and take up to 30-60 days to fully cure before dry. It is important to note security window films will not strengthen, keep from breaking or make glass ‘bullet proof‘. The best way to describe the performance of installed security window films is to compare the results to the performance of a broken windshield after a car collision.

Read more âATLANTA (Dec. 9, 2024) âÂ Peachtree Group (âPeachtreeâ) has reached a significant milestone in Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (CPACE) financing, surpassing the $1.0 billion markâa distinction shared by only a select few companies in the industry. In 2024 alone, Peachtree completed 22 CPACE transactions across the U.S., surpassing its previous record for CPACE originations.\"In 2019, we launched CPACE, and today we've surpassed our first billionâa testament to the exceptional team and the strength of Peachtreeâs vision,â said Jared Schlosser, Peachtreeâs Executive Vice President of Hotel Lending and Head of CPACE. âOur strong foundation has not only fueled Peachtreeâs success in CPACE financing but also solidified its position as a leader in the broader commercial real estate lending market.âIn the most recent loan origination rankings by the Mortgage Bankers Association, Peachtree was ranked as the seventh-largest commercial real estate investor-driven lender in the U.S.The firmâs $1.0 billion in CPACE financing is rooted in hospitality, which remains its largest segment comprising approximately 45% of its total. However, Peachtree has successfully expanded into other sectors, particularly residential communities (including multifamily, student housing and senior living), which now represent 22% of the portfolio or $220 million. Additionally, the firm has executed numerous CPACE transactions across industrial, mixed-use and office sectors, showcasing its versatility.âIn this challenging lending market, CPACE financing has emerged as a crucial source of liquidity for all commercial real estate sectors. This financing option is becoming increasingly essential as owners grapple with looming debt maturities and limited refinancing opportunities,â Schlosser said.Commercial real estate remains in a turbulent period with trillions of dollars in debt maturing and refinancing becoming increasingly difficult due to tighter lending standards from traditional lenders. These challenges are reshaping the industry and forcing property owners to seek alternative financing solutions.âCPACE has been a game-changer, offering long-term fixed-rate financing that lowers the cost of capital while enabling property owners to pursue energy-efficient upgrades with reduced financial strain,â Schlosser said. âPeachtree is proud to lead the way in expanding access to this innovative solution, helping owners across all commercial real estate sectors.âIn just over a decade, CPACE has reached a cumulative $7.2 billion in U.S. commercial real estate financings, according to PACE Nation, confirming the growing market adoption and acceptance of this financing tool.About Peachtree GroupPeachtree Group is a vertically integrated investment management firm specializing in identifying and capitalizing on opportunities in dislocated markets, anchored by commercial real estate.

This latest DST offering is the third to close this year following the completion of the Residence Inn Tampa Wesley Chapel DST in November.Â Peachtreeâs DST hospitality acquisitions continue to present compelling opportunities for 1031 exchange investors seeking to reinvest proceeds from the sale of appreciated real estate while enjoying tax deferral benefits and maintaining a strong allocation within the thriving hotel sector.Â The Home2 Suites by Hilton St. Augustine I-95 benefits from its strategic location off I-95 and its proximity to St. Augustine, one of Floridaâs most popular tourist destinations. Known for its historic charm and vibrant economy, St. Augustine draws millions of visitors annually, creating year-round demand for hospitality services.Â âWith its premier location along the I-95 corridor, strong population growth in the surrounding area and St. Augustineâs rich historical and cultural appeal, this property is a natural fit for our DST portfolio,â said Tim Witt, president of 1031 Exchange/DST Products at Peachtree. âThis extended-stay hotel is well-positioned to meet the needs of leisure and business travelers alike, offering a blend of modern convenience and comfortable accommodations.âÂ Peachtreeâs six DST acquisitions â spanning diverse, high-growth markets â demonstrate the companyâs expertise in identifying strategic opportunities within the hospitality sector. These acquisitions, including the recently launched Home2Suites by Hilton St. Augustine I-95, represent approximately $175 million in debt-free real estate transactions.Â âOur focus on recognized hotel brands, value-add opportunities and Peachtreeâs experienced hospitality management team ensures long-term potential for investors,â Witt said.Â Peachtree emphasizes its commitment to offering investors tailored solutions aligned with 1031 exchange principles, enabling the seamless transition of capital gains into passive investments in the hospitality sector.This property features institutional-quality construction, spacious suites with extended-stay amenities and strong brand recognition. Located just minutes from St. Augustineâs historic downtown, the hotel offers convenient access to top attractions, including the Castillo de San Marcos, St. Augustine Premium Outlets and pristine beaches.Recent nearby developments, including mixed-use projects, healthcare facilities and luxury apartments, further enhance the propertyâs appeal and position for sustained demand in the years ahead.Â With the launch of its sixth DST investment, Peachtree Group continues to lead in offering innovative real estate investment solutions. By capitalizing on positive secular trends in travel, inflation-resilient pricing models and the operational complexities of the hospitality sector, Peachtree delivers strong potential for long-term success and stability in its DST portfolio.âAbout Peachtree GroupPeachtree Group is a vertically integrated investment management firm specializing in identifying and capitalizing on opportunities in dislocated markets, anchored by commercial real estate.

With rates expected to remain elevated, Friedman states, \"there's less negative leverage,\" making the sector increasingly attractive.Â Regarding office spaces, Friedman sees potential for recovery. \"I think we're heading towards a bottoming across the office sector,\" he said, pointing to rising vacant spaces being repurposed and transformed for new uses. \"I think we're heading towards it being more investable,\" he added.Â To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more CatalystsÂ here.âPress ReleaseCredit/CPACE5 min readPeachtree Group Surpasses $1.0 Billion in CPACE FinancingPeachtree Group has reached a significant milestone in Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (CPACE) financing, surpassing the $1.0 billion mark. Read more âATLANTA (Dec. 9, 2024) âÂ Peachtree Group (âPeachtreeâ) has reached a significant milestone in Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (CPACE) financing, surpassing the $1.0 billion markâa distinction shared by only a select few companies in the industry. In 2024 alone, Peachtree completed 22 CPACE transactions across the U.S., surpassing its previous record for CPACE originations.\"In 2019, we launched CPACE, and today we've surpassed our first billionâa testament to the exceptional team and the strength of Peachtreeâs vision,â said Jared Schlosser, Peachtreeâs Executive Vice President of Hotel Lending and Head of CPACE. âOur strong foundation has not only fueled Peachtreeâs success in CPACE financing but also solidified its position as a leader in the broader commercial real estate lending market.âIn the most recent loan origination rankings by the Mortgage Bankers Association, Peachtree was ranked as the seventh-largest commercial real estate investor-driven lender in the U.S.The firmâs $1.0 billion in CPACE financing is rooted in hospitality, which remains its largest segment comprising approximately 45% of its total. However, Peachtree has successfully expanded into other sectors, particularly residential communities (including multifamily, student housing and senior living), which now represent 22% of the portfolio or $220 million. Additionally, the firm has executed numerous CPACE transactions across industrial, mixed-use and office sectors, showcasing its versatility.âIn this challenging lending market, CPACE financing has emerged as a crucial source of liquidity for all commercial real estate sectors. This financing option is becoming increasingly essential as owners grapple with looming debt maturities and limited refinancing opportunities,â Schlosser said.Commercial real estate remains in a turbulent period with trillions of dollars in debt maturing and refinancing becoming increasingly difficult due to tighter lending standards from traditional lenders. These challenges are reshaping the industry and forcing property owners to seek alternative financing solutions.âCPACE has been a game-changer, offering long-term fixed-rate financing that lowers the cost of capital while enabling property owners to pursue energy-efficient upgrades with reduced financial strain,â Schlosser said. âPeachtree is proud to lead the way in expanding access to this innovative solution, helping owners across all commercial real estate sectors.âIn just over a decade, CPACE has reached a cumulative $7.2 billion in U.S. commercial real estate financings, according to PACE Nation, confirming the growing market adoption and acceptance of this financing tool.About Peachtree GroupPeachtree Group is a vertically integrated investment management firm specializing in identifying and capitalizing on opportunities in dislocated markets, anchored by commercial real estate. Today, the company manages billions in capital across acquisitions, development and lending, augmented by services designed to protect, support and grow its investments.For more information, visit www.peachtreegroup.com.âPress ReleaseDST5 min readPeachtree Group Expands Hospitality Portfolio with Launch of New DST Investment in Iconic St. AugustinePeachtree Group has announced the acquisition of its sixth hotel property structured as a Delaware Statutory Trust (DST) with the 90-key Home2 Suites by Hilton St. Augustine I-95 in the greater Jacksonville, Fla., area.Read more âââATLANTA (Dec. 3,2024) - Peachtree Group (âPeachtreeâ), a leading commercial real estate investment firm with a multi-billion-dollar portfolio of equity and debt investments, has announced the acquisition of its sixth hotel property structured as a Delaware Statutory Trust (DST) with the 90-key Home2 Suites by Hilton St. Augustine I-95 in the greater Jacksonville, Fla., area. This latest DST offering is the third to close this year following the completion of the Residence Inn Tampa Wesley Chapel DST in November.Â Peachtreeâs DST hospitality acquisitions continue to present compelling opportunities for 1031 exchange investors seeking to reinvest proceeds from the sale of appreciated real estate while enjoying tax deferral benefits and maintaining a strong allocation within the thriving hotel sector.Â The Home2 Suites by Hilton St. Augustine I-95 benefits from its strategic location off I-95 and its proximity to St. Augustine, one of Floridaâs most popular tourist destinations. Known for its historic charm and vibrant economy, St. Augustine draws millions of visitors annually, creating year-round demand for hospitality services.Â âWith its premier location along the I-95 corridor, strong population growth in the surrounding area and St. Augustineâs rich historical and cultural appeal, this property is a natural fit for our DST portfolio,â said Tim Witt, president of 1031 Exchange/DST Products at Peachtree. âThis extended-stay hotel is well-positioned to meet the needs of leisure and business travelers alike, offering a blend of modern convenience and comfortable accommodations.âÂ Peachtreeâs six DST acquisitions â spanning diverse, high-growth markets â demonstrate the companyâs expertise in identifying strategic opportunities within the hospitality sector. These acquisitions, including the recently launched Home2Suites by Hilton St. Augustine I-95, represent approximately $175 million in debt-free real estate transactions.Â âOur focus on recognized hotel brands, value-add opportunities and Peachtreeâs experienced hospitality management team ensures long-term potential for investors,â Witt said.Â Peachtree emphasizes its commitment to offering investors tailored solutions aligned with 1031 exchange principles, enabling the seamless transition of capital gains into passive investments in the hospitality sector.This property features institutional-quality construction, spacious suites with extended-stay amenities and strong brand recognition. Located just minutes from St. Augustineâs historic downtown, the hotel offers convenient access to top attractions, including the Castillo de San Marcos, St. Augustine Premium Outlets and pristine beaches.Recent nearby developments, including mixed-use projects, healthcare facilities and luxury apartments, further enhance the propertyâs appeal and position for sustained demand in the years ahead.Â With the launch of its sixth DST investment, Peachtree Group continues to lead in offering innovative real estate investment solutions. By capitalizing on positive secular trends in travel, inflation-resilient pricing models and the operational complexities of the hospitality sector, Peachtree delivers strong potential for long-term success and stability in its DST portfolio.âAbout Peachtree GroupPeachtree Group is a vertically integrated investment management firm specializing in identifying and capitalizing on opportunities in dislocated markets, anchored by commercial real estate.

History In 1983, Atlanta School of Gymnastics Head Boys Team Coach Gene Watson, founded the \"Peachtree Men's Classic\" with the support of booster club families Cook, Kirksey and a host of other ASG families and friends in the gymnastics community. For 31 years, the tireless efforts of Head Coaches Gene Watson, Joe Strank and Nathan Simmons have produced over 35 scholarship recipients, 15 National champions, 20 National team members and 60 National Qualifiers who all consider the Peachtree Meet home. Well known for impeccable southern hospitality, the Peachtree competition has hosted 2 International Teams, 5 Olympians and World Team Members. In 2009, following the untimely death of mentor and ASG owner, Tom Cook, Nathan Simmons, founded \"The Peachtree Invitational\" with the purpose of continuing the rich legacy of the Peachtree Meet while expanding its mission to preserve and support men's gymnastics throughout the country.

Compare Life Insurance Quotes With Peachtree Insurance Advisors Peachtree Life Insurance is dedicated to securing the best life insurance rates for our clients. As an independent agency with over 16 years in the industry, we use our experience and expertise to help you make the right decision about protecting your loved ones with life insurance. We work with over 50 top life insurance companies and provide expert guidance to make sure you know all the right steps to take in selecting a policy. Free, Instant Quote Engine Our instant term life insurance quote engine is the most comprehensive one available anywhere on the Web. We actually use three of the best quote engines in the industry and provide customized quotes upon request. Take a few minutes to check out our quote engine. This tool is an excellent way to shop the market and see the most competitive insurance companies. You can also see the financial ratings for all the carriers. If you’re not sure how to determine which carriers are the most financially sound, let us help you in this area. Call or email — whatever works best for you. We promise to respond promptly. Many clients come to us for help after they had a tough time dealing with one of the online “mega” agencies. Either they received an unfavorable outcome (a “rate-up” or declination) or the application process bogged down somewhere along the way. Some folks come to us after they felt they were pressured towards one or two carriers. At Peachtree Life Insurance, you will work with someone who cares about your situation and isn’t simply an order taker. Testimonials – Reputation is Important On our testimonial page, you will see many folks from our home state of Georgia. These clients gave us permission to use their full name, location, and profession (if applicable). There are hundreds of online agencies that have great looking sites, but they are run by agents with limited experience and expertise. We hope our testimonial page gives you a high level of comfort and confidence, knowing you are dealing with a reputable agency that has stood the test of time. We started local, in the metro Atlanta area, and over time we have grown to the point that we now have clients all over the country. We still pride ourselves on providing the hometown approach and want our clients to feel like they are welcome to drop by our office anytime. Expertise is Essential. If you’re not sure how much coverage you need or how long you need it, we can help. There isn’t one solution that fits every situation, so we can help you make these decisions. There are “rules of thumb” that can be helpful as a starting point. We also provide a life insurance calculator that factors in things you might not normally consider. However, it helps to speak with an expert advisor about your unique needs. Sometimes, it makes sense to “ladder” term policies. We were interviewed by Bankrate.com because of our expertise in this area. With a background as a financial / investment advisor, Greg can help with many areas of life insurance, such as understanding the difference between term, whole life and mortgage life insurance. Some folks know exactly what coverage they want and need; others look to us for advice. Feel free to run quotes and read our blog posts…then just let us know when you have questions. Again, we’re here to guide you through the process from start to finish. Independent Agency – You Deserve to See All The Carriers on the Market As a small, independent agency, we have the ability to work with some carriers that the largest agencies simply cannot. To illustrate this point, see our review on Zander Insurance (the agency recommended by Dave Ramsey). Most large agencies don’t offer several of the best, low-cost term carriers available, such as Ohio National Life. See our review of Ohio National here. Not only do the mega agencies represent a limited number of companies, they cannot train their call center employees to the level of expertise you will receive with us. This means you will get the right policy and not overpay because of an agent’s incompetence or an underwriting oversight. We know how and why various carriers underwrite health conditions differently. We use this knowledge to make sure our clients get the best possible rates. We are Your Advocate and Work Hard on Your Behalf Oftentimes, agents and call center employees do not advocate for their clients and they settle for an unfavorable underwriting decision. That happens all the time in this industry; it’s the easy path. Usually applicants are unaware that their agent could have made a stronger case to the underwriter on their behalf. We simply will not allow that happen to our valued clients! It takes a combination of experience, expertise, hard work and a caring heart to ensure our clients get the very best. That is our guarantee to you. Although term life insurance can be treated as a commodity, we make sure our clients know all the riders and policy provisions that can make a difference in plan selection. Whether it’s the policy’s convertibility options, waiver of premium rider, or other provisions, we will help you understand your options and make an informed decision. Sometimes people want to make sure a small portion of their life insurance doesn’t expire. We offer “term to age 100” or “term for life” plans and review all the top companies. Laddering your life policies can be a good strategy, depending on your situation. You may even decide a universal life insurance policy is the way to go, as it’s a cheap alternative to permanent coverage. A Proven Process The process of selecting and applying for a life insurance policy can be tedious. We are here to help make the entire process as easy as possible. You will not in any way be pressured. Your timetable is what matters most, so we will make sure your questions are answered quickly and to your satisfaction. We have a proven process whereby we get preliminary rates based on your health, family history, and other factors. After the preliminary work is done, we give you the results and help you make the best choice. Some insurance plans are “non-medical” and have a very simple application process; other plans require a visit from a paramedical examiner to perform a mini-physical. We arrange these no-cost exams and make sure everything proceeds smoothly. Life Insurance Through Your Professional Association – Is it Better? Sometimes, people believe they will get a better deal if they purchase life insurance through their professional association. At times, this assumption is correct. However, in the vast majority of cases, you can find better, lower-cost coverage elsewhere. We review the life insurance coverage (and provide comparison quotes) you can obtain through the AICPA here, and the American Bar Association here. In addition to life insurance… We offer disability and Medicare insurance too. We work with 10 of the best disability insurance carriers. Unlike life insurance, there are a limited number of quality insurance companies offering disability insurance. We work with the best carriers and prepare customized proposals. We discovered a way to save our clients a significant amount of premium by selecting a less popular type of disability coverage. We have helped hundreds of people, including business owners and independent contractors, understand the pitfalls to avoid when purchasing a disability policy. Disability insurance is designed to protect your most valuable asset – your ability to earn an income. We can help those looking for quotes and advice for the best Medicare Supplement plans available in your state. We have the most comprehensive quote engine and the knowledge to help you make the right decisions. We look forward to helping you with your insurance needs!

To illustrate this point, see our review on Zander Insurance (the agency recommended by Dave Ramsey). Most large agencies don’t offer several of the best, low-cost term carriers available, such as Ohio National Life. See our review of Ohio National here. Not only do the mega agencies represent a limited number of companies, they cannot train their call center employees to the level of expertise you will receive with us. This means you will get the right policy and not overpay because of an agent’s incompetence or an underwriting oversight. We know how and why various carriers underwrite health conditions differently. We use this knowledge to make sure our clients get the best possible rates. We are Your Advocate and Work Hard on Your Behalf Oftentimes, agents and call center employees do not advocate for their clients and they settle for an unfavorable underwriting decision. That happens all the time in this industry; it’s the easy path. Usually applicants are unaware that their agent could have made a stronger case to the underwriter on their behalf. We simply will not allow that happen to our valued clients! It takes a combination of experience, expertise, hard work and a caring heart to ensure our clients get the very best. That is our guarantee to you. Although term life insurance can be treated as a commodity, we make sure our clients know all the riders and policy provisions that can make a difference in plan selection. Whether it’s the policy’s convertibility options, waiver of premium rider, or other provisions, we will help you understand your options and make an informed decision. Sometimes people want to make sure a small portion of their life insurance doesn’t expire. We offer “term to age 100” or “term for life” plans and review all the top companies. Laddering your life policies can be a good strategy, depending on your situation. You may even decide a universal life insurance policy is the way to go, as it’s a cheap alternative to permanent coverage. A Proven Process The process of selecting and applying for a life insurance policy can be tedious. We are here to help make the entire process as easy as possible. You will not in any way be pressured. Your timetable is what matters most, so we will make sure your questions are answered quickly and to your satisfaction. We have a proven process whereby we get preliminary rates based on your health, family history, and other factors. After the preliminary work is done, we give you the results and help you make the best choice. Some insurance plans are “non-medical” and have a very simple application process; other plans require a visit from a paramedical examiner to perform a mini-physical. We arrange these no-cost exams and make sure everything proceeds smoothly. Life Insurance Through Your Professional Association – Is it Better? Sometimes, people believe they will get a better deal if they purchase life insurance through their professional association. At times, this assumption is correct. However, in the vast majority of cases, you can find better, lower-cost coverage elsewhere. We review the life insurance coverage (and provide comparison quotes) you can obtain through the AICPA here, and the American Bar Association here. In addition to life insurance… We offer disability and Medicare insurance too. We work with 10 of the best disability insurance carriers. Unlike life insurance, there are a limited number of quality insurance companies offering disability insurance. We work with the best carriers and prepare customized proposals. We discovered a way to save our clients a significant amount of premium by selecting a less popular type of disability coverage. We have helped hundreds of people, including business owners and independent contractors, understand the pitfalls to avoid when purchasing a disability policy. Disability insurance is designed to protect your most valuable asset – your ability to earn an income. We can help those looking for quotes and advice for the best Medicare Supplement plans available in your state. We have the most comprehensive quote engine and the knowledge to help you make the right decisions. We look forward to helping you with your insurance needs!
