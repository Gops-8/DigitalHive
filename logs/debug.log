This triggered us to advertise medals through online and print media to promote the Headlands’ portfolio and further illustrate the unique selling points of our products. “With international food and spirits awards proliferating, it can become unclear what the worth of a gold medal is.

Most incorrectly believe that standard homeowner/landlord insurance policies will cover them and their business. They could not be more wrong! A sober living home is a business and needs proper insurance. Not only is there liability and property exposure but there is also professional liability, workers compensation, and sexual and physical harassment exposure.. add it all up and you have a need for a comprehensive commercial policy. The good news: You have come to the right place! Simply click on the Get Quote button and let our agents get you the right coverage at the right price! Quote now Commercial Liability Even though you may only have a few tenants, there are always uncertainties. We help provide the best risk management advice to protect your business and assets. Liability could protect you from the acts of your tenants as well as guests. Property Coverage Whether you own or rent the home, there is a good chance you need to insure it. Even more importantly is that coverage may also include loss of rents in the event of a covered claim. That coverage alone could save you from financial ruin! Business Auto – Non-Owned Auto If you have a business vehicle then we can help, however, if you have a house manager use their own car and do a few errands for the home you may have an exposure. We can add hired/non owner coverage to protect the operator in the event an employee drives their own car in the name of the business. Professional Liability – Errors and Omissions Perhaps the most misunderstood and under-utilized coverage for a Sober Living Home is professional liability. It is also known as Errors and Omission (E&O). Most of your tenants have come to you because they have relied on your advice or expertise. The reliance on your expertise creates possible exposure that only this coverage can provide. Often, we are told that there is simply a standard tenant landlord relationship. But that does not hold up when there are morning rituals, counseling, trips to 12 step and more. To protect your business and income, you need to have professional liability Sexual & Physical Harassment Sober living homes are not immune to possible tenant harassment by managers or other tenants. There can lapses of judgment or sobriety that can result in a lawsuit being slapped on the owner or operator regardless of how well they know the manager and tenants. Coverage from some carriers is mandatory in some states due to the litigious exposure. Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance plays an important role in a sober living environment. A data breach with HIPPA law information could require out of pocket expenses as well as payments to third parties who may sue for damages. We can review and determine what your individual needs are. Workers Compensation Workers compensation for sober living homes covers employees inured on the job or for work related illnesses. Additional exposure for those that have vehicles whether owned by the company or individually by the employee. Umbrella – Excess Umbrella insurance provides additional layers of protection to your existing insurance policies. Some third parties will require higher limits than standard policies provide.. We’ll help find the right solution to cover all your business needs Quote now Coping with Challenges in Sober Living Operations: Top Ten Concerns and Solutions Feb 20, 2024Operating a sober living home involves navigating a complex web of legal, ethical, and medical responsibilities. Insurance is a critical component in ensuring that you are protected against the array of risks associated with this type of care facility.

On Wednesday, a strong upper-level trough is forecasted to sit over the Northern Great Plains. A strong jet streak is also forecasted to extend from the Ohio River Valley up into the New England region. Through Wednesday into Thursday, a surface low-pressure system is forecasted to move from Texas Northeastward through the Ohio River Valley and up into New England. This low-pressure system will extend a cold front into the Southeastern United States. There’s good model agreement that the cold front should move through the Daytona Region around midnight Thursday into Friday. Ahead of this front on Thursday afternoon, models also agree on scattered thunderstorms initiating prior to the front moving through. Timing could vary, but as of right now expect storms to be in the area from 4PM to 7 PM on Thursday. After these storms move through, the convection that was initiated by the cold front should die out before reaching Daytona. After the cold front moves through, Some showers could linger around the region through the day. Expect skies to calm into Saturday.As we move into the weekend, a second upper-level trough is forecasted to move through the US. The trough is forecasted to deepen as it moves Eastward, and by Saturday afternoon lead to a surface low-pressure system forming over Mississippi. As we work into Saturday night into Sunday, this surface low-pressure system is forecasted to move Northeastward. This low-pressure system is forecasted to be much stronger than the previous one and should be further South. This will lead to a stronger trailing cold front impacting the Daytona Region sometime on Sunday. Again, it’s too far out to give any accurate timing on the frontal passage, but current models have it passing the Daytona Region sometime between Noon & 6 PM, BUT EXPECT THIS TO CHANGE AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE 500.We will continue to update the forecast throughout the week!Updated February 12, 2025, 10:50 AM EDT AdvertisingSpace Available Daytona Beach, Florida WEATHER AdvertisingSpace Available More about Daytona International Speedway The history of Daytona International Speedway began in 1953 when Bill France Sr. realized the days of racing on the beach were numbered due to spreading land usage of a rapidly growing population and huge race crowds.

Casa Traca is een kleinschalige en informele Bed and Breakfast in midden Portugal. Een rustige plek weg van het massa toerisme maar toch centraal gelegen in de gemeente Arganil, Coimbra. Bij B&B Casa Traca staat genieten voorop. Genieten van dit mooie land in al haar facetten. Genieten van het niets hoeven, onthaasten en ontstressen. Dit gevoel van thuiskomen op vakantie wil ik mijn gasten graag meegeven! De tuin, met haar vele loungeplekken, staat geheel ter beschikking voor jullie, mijn gasten. B&B Casa Traca ligt halverwege de de berg Monte' Alto . Vanuit de tuin wandelt u zo naar de top van de berg met de prachtige kapel en het fabuleuze uitzicht. Casa Traca beschikt over 4 royale themakamers waar u heerlijk tot rust kan komen, na bijvoorbeeld een vakantiedag naar de watervallen van Fraga da Pena en het leistenendorp Píodão. Gelegen in het beschermde natuurgebied van Serra do Açor; Serra do Açor Protected Landscape . Ik hanteer het hele jaar door dezelfde prijzen. Zo heeft u ook in het hoogseizoen een betaalbare vakantie in onze accommodatie in Arganil om te ontspannen en te genieten!

U vindt Casa Traca in het authentieke dorpje Valbona. In Valbona lijkt de tijd te hebben stilgestaan. Er is een kleine dorpswinkel annex café. Er zijn bossen om heerlijke wandelingen te maken, bergen voor de prachtigste bergtochten met de auto of de motor. Rivieren om te zwemmen en te kayakken, watervallen om te genieten van de kracht van de natuur. Ook een dagje strand aan de Atlantische Oceaan is geen probleem: Figueira da Foz ligt op een uurtje rijden. Bed and Breakfast Casa Traca in Arganil maakt onderdeel uit van de Serra do Açor Protected Landscape. Casa Traca is hiervoor aangesloten bij de organisatie Natural.pt /ICNF Portugal.

Installment Loans: Complete Guide on Types, Benefits, and Application ProcessFor personal finance, a reliable partner is vital for borrowers who want beneficial financial solutions. It is important to learn about installment loans fully to empower borrowers with financial tools that can empower them to fulfill their diverse needs.According to a recent study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), individuals who grasp the fundamentals of installment loans are more likely to manage their finances effectively and avoid common pitfalls.Let’s check out what experts of Cascade Springs Loan have to tell you about installment loans.What Are Installment Loans?At its core, an installment loan is a straightforward financial tool. It’s a sum of money borrowed from a lender that you repay in fixed, regular installments over an agreed-upon period. Each payment covers both the principal amount and interest, providing clarity on your repayment schedule.The mechanics are simple. When you take out an installment loan, you receive a lump sum. You then commit to repaying this amount, plus interest, in fixed portions over the loan term. Monthly payments remain consistent, making budgeting more manageable.Installment loans serve various purposes. They’re often employed for significant expenses like home repairs, medical bills, or unexpected emergencies. Additionally, they can be used for planned investments, such as education or home improvement. The flexibility of installment loans makes them a practical choice for navigating life’s financial challenges with predictability.Types of Installment LoansPayday loans are short-term loans designed to cover immediate expenses until your next paycheck. They typically involve smaller amounts and shorter repayment periods compared to other installment loans.Features and Eligibility CriteriaSpeed: Quick approval and disbursement, often within a day.Eligibility: Usually requires proof of income, a checking account, and identification.Amount: Generally smaller amounts based on your income.Pros and ConsPros:Immediate financial relief.Minimal documentation.Cons:Higher interest rates.Short repayment period can lead to a cycle of borrowing.Installment loans are a more flexible borrowing option. They involve borrowing a lump sum and repaying it in fixed, regular installments over a more extended period.Features and BenefitsPredictable Payments: Monthly payments remain consistent, aiding in budgeting.Higher Amounts: Generally, installment loans allow for larger loan amounts.Extended Terms: Longer repayment periods, providing more time to repay.Wondering how it differs from payday loans? Here are some main variations:Repayment Structure: Paying back in fixed installments over a more extended period.Amount and Terms: Typically involves larger amounts and more extended repayment terms compared to payday loans.Interest Rates: While interest rates vary, they are often more reasonable than payday loans.Understanding the distinctions between payday loans and installment loans empowers borrowers to choose the option that aligns best with their financial needs.Secured vs. Unsecured Installment LoansSecured installment loans involve providing collateral, which is an asset that acts as security for the loan. This can be anything from a vehicle to valuable possessions. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender can claim the collateral.AdvantagesLower Interest Rates: Secured loans often have lower interest rates due to the reduced risk for the lender.Higher Approval Odds: Collateral provides assurance, making approval more likely.DisadvantagesRisk of Asset Loss: Failing to repay could result in the loss of the collateral.Stricter Eligibility: Requirements may include a valuable asset, limiting accessibility for some.Unsecured installment loans do not require collateral. Approval is based on the borrower’s creditworthiness, income, and financial history.BenefitsNo Asset Risk: Borrowers don’t risk losing personal asse

Cats knead for different reasons. Nursing kittens knead to assist their mothers in producing milk. Adult cats who have been nursing kittens may also knead for comfort. However, some mature cats knead on their owner’s laps to express affection, while others knead, stimulating their sense glands to mark their territory. Why Do Cats Have Whiskers? Whiskas follicles are surrounded by sensory cells. These sensory cells guide cats through daily functions. It activates the cat’s sense of solid objects when touched, helping them to navigate the environment. Likewise, it also aids vision and is a medium for communication. Whiskas show movement when cats are stressed. Why Do Cats Wag Their Tails? Cats communicate their feelings by wagging their tails. If your cat thumps their tail, it implies that they are upset and something is irritating them. Similarly, twitching the end of the tail indicates that they are playing or hunting, but it could also indicate that your cat is moderately upset if they are not playing. If your cat is swinging its tail from side to side, it could indicate that they are paying attention to something. If your cat’s tail quivers, it suggests it is pleased to see you or another cat.

Cats are crepuscular beings which means that they are more active when it’s twilight, such as when hunting for their prey at night. What is a group of cats called? The group of cats is known as a clowder or a glaring. If there are two cats, it is termed a pair, and if there are three or more cats, it is called a clowder. The word clowder comes from the word clodder in Middle English, which was introduced in the late

View Judges View Winners 2024 Winners Winners of our 2024 edition View Past Winners Testimonials Being a medal winner at the LSC has had a significant impact on our sales. One of our business goals for the year was to gain more traction in the on-trade. Recognition from LSC has acted as a seal of approval in this respect as the competition is judged by some of the world's leading figures from the hospitality sector. This includes a listing with a high-end UK-wide department store whose buyer was on the judging panel. This also includes the opening up of a new export market after we were approached by an importer who had seen coverage of our success. This is no coincidence. The LSC team did a superb job of promoting the competition and providing a platform for the medal winners. North Uist Distillery Co "Retailers and wholesalers who were 'indifferent' to our products are now queuing up at ‘our door'. The curiosity it has caused amongst the trade and public has increased our sales dramatically. Finally, the award has caused BBC South Today and BBC Radio Oxford to interview us, giving even greater exposure." - Chalgrove Artisan Distillery Chalgrove Artisan Distillery "We were thrilled not just for the recognition, but because it comes from a comprehensively considered competition that aims to reward whiskeys that are high quality and attractively packaged." - Andrea Myers, Vice President of Marketing for Heaven's Door. Heaven's Door "Winning a Gold medal and Best Package really is fantastic! I and my wife have worked on the project for over 2 and a half years, so it really is amazing to get such positive feedback after working so hard on this project." - Mallorca Distillery Mallorca Distillery Gordon Chalmers, Head Distiller and Co-owner of Tamborine Mountain Distillery, Queensland, Australia, shares his opinion on the London Spirits Competition: “Only one word needed: fantastic!” Tamborine Mountain Distillery The London Spirits Competition provided us with an independent evaluation of our products and invaluable feedback about tasting notes. We were happy with the individualized feedback and care taken by organizers to ensure products arrived on time and were given the attention they deserved. We will definitely enter again. “Winning Gold medals at the London Spirits Competition has proven to be a powerful mechanism to attract international buyers to Headlands’ products. This triggered us to advertise medals through online and print media to promote the Headlands’ portfolio and further illustrate the unique selling points of our products. “With international food and spirits awards proliferating, it can become unclear what the worth of a gold medal is.

Home Insurance Coverage Video Resources FAQ Contact Select Page Sober Living Home Insurance Affordable and Comprehensive Insurance coverage tailored for owners of sober living homes Quote now ; Sober Living Operators have their own unique exposures when it comes to insurance. Most incorrectly believe that standard homeowner/landlord insurance policies will cover them and their business. They could not be more wrong! A sober living home is a business and needs proper insurance. Not only is there liability and property exposure but there is also professional liability, workers compensation, and sexual and physical harassment exposure.. add it all up and you have a need for a comprehensive commercial policy. The good news: You have come to the right place! Simply click on the Get Quote button and let our agents get you the right coverage at the right price! Quote now Commercial Liability Even though you may only have a few tenants, there are always uncertainties. We help provide the best risk management advice to protect your business and assets. Liability could protect you from the acts of your tenants as well as guests. Property Coverage Whether you own or rent the home, there is a good chance you need to insure it. Even more importantly is that coverage may also include loss of rents in the event of a covered claim. That coverage alone could save you from financial ruin! Business Auto – Non-Owned Auto If you have a business vehicle then we can help, however, if you have a house manager use their own car and do a few errands for the home you may have an exposure. We can add hired/non owner coverage to protect the operator in the event an employee drives their own car in the name of the business. Professional Liability – Errors and Omissions Perhaps the most misunderstood and under-utilized coverage for a Sober Living Home is professional liability. It is also known as Errors and Omission (E&O). Most of your tenants have come to you because they have relied on your advice or expertise. The reliance on your expertise creates possible exposure that only this coverage can provide. Often, we are told that there is simply a standard tenant landlord relationship. But that does not hold up when there are morning rituals, counseling, trips to 12 step and more. To protect your business and income, you need to have professional liability Sexual & Physical Harassment Sober living homes are not immune to possible tenant harassment by managers or other tenants. There can lapses of judgment or sobriety that can result in a lawsuit being slapped on the owner or operator regardless of how well they know the manager and tenants. Coverage from some carriers is mandatory in some states due to the litigious exposure. Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance plays an important role in a sober living environment. A data breach with HIPPA law information could require out of pocket expenses as well as payments to third parties who may sue for damages. We can review and determine what your individual needs are. Workers Compensation Workers compensation for sober living homes covers employees inured on the job or for work related illnesses. Additional exposure for those that have vehicles whether owned by the company or individually by the employee. Umbrella – Excess Umbrella insurance provides additional layers of protection to your existing insurance policies. Some third parties will require higher limits than standard policies provide.. We’ll help find the right solution to cover all your business needs Quote now Coping with Challenges in Sober Living Operations: Top Ten Concerns and Solutions Feb 20, 2024Operating a sober living home involves navigating a complex web of legal, ethical, and medical responsibilities. Insurance is a critical component in ensuring that you are protected against the array of risks associated with this type of care facility.

On Wednesday, a strong upper-level trough is forecasted to sit over the Northern Great Plains. A strong jet streak is also forecasted to extend from the Ohio River Valley up into the New England region. Through Wednesday into Thursday, a surface low-pressure system is forecasted to move from Texas Northeastward through the Ohio River Valley and up into New England. This low-pressure system will extend a cold front into the Southeastern United States. There’s good model agreement that the cold front should move through the Daytona Region around midnight Thursday into Friday. Ahead of this front on Thursday afternoon, models also agree on scattered thunderstorms initiating prior to the front moving through. Timing could vary, but as of right now expect storms to be in the area from 4PM to 7 PM on Thursday. After these storms move through, the convection that was initiated by the cold front should die out before reaching Daytona. After the cold front moves through, Some showers could linger around the region through the day. Expect skies to calm into Saturday.As we move into the weekend, a second upper-level trough is forecasted to move through the US. The trough is forecasted to deepen as it moves Eastward, and by Saturday afternoon lead to a surface low-pressure system forming over Mississippi. As we work into Saturday night into Sunday, this surface low-pressure system is forecasted to move Northeastward. This low-pressure system is forecasted to be much stronger than the previous one and should be further South. This will lead to a stronger trailing cold front impacting the Daytona Region sometime on Sunday. Again, it’s too far out to give any accurate timing on the frontal passage, but current models have it passing the Daytona Region sometime between Noon & 6 PM, BUT EXPECT THIS TO CHANGE AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE 500.We will continue to update the forecast throughout the week!Updated February 12, 2025, 10:50 AM EDT AdvertisingSpace Available Daytona Beach, Florida WEATHER AdvertisingSpace Available More about Daytona International Speedway The history of Daytona International Speedway began in 1953 when Bill France Sr. realized the days of racing on the beach were numbered due to spreading land usage of a rapidly growing population and huge race crowds.

Purchasing a vehicle is a significant financial commitment, and no one deserves to be stuck with a car, truck or RV that malfunctions or has serious defects. These faulty vehicles are referred to as "lemons." Every state has a lemon law that safeguards buyers if their purchase does not meet the expected quality standards. Lemon law protection ensures that car manufacturers uphold their warranties and provide suitable remedies to the consumer. California itself has some of the strongest consumer protection laws in the country. Specifically, two acts address defective products: Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act: Provides a legal mechanism for all buyers of warrantied consumer goods purchased for non-commercial use to seek damages for faulty items. Tanner Consumer Protection Act: A provision within the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act that specifically addresses defective vehicles and sets out the guidelines for determining whether a vehicle is a lemon.

Third generation woodworkers based in the Los Angeles area and specializing in custom woodwork. From tables and bookcases to bed frames and dressers, every piece is handcrafted and made to the highest standards. Along with the signature collection, fully custom projects are also welcomed. A rarity these days, but an important opportunity that has afforded us the chance to continually sharpen our skills. Over the past 10 plus years we’ve made not only custom furniture, but also built-ins, shelves, mantels, home goods, faux beams, and wall treatments. Basically, anything with wood you’ve seen on the show Fixer Upper. “We got going back in 2013, making small things for family and friends. But really, the true roots of the business go back much further than that. My grandfather was a master carpenter and cabinet maker. He was also a business owner and leader in his industry at a time when few Mexican- Americans were. He taught me carpentry and the importance of hard work. It was his influence that gave me the desire and belief in myself to start my own business someday.” -Steven Although really close the two are both very different people. Family members say Steven showed signs of artistic talent even at a very young age. In a story told countless times, his parents recall when as a toddler he covered an entire wall in crayon. This “mural” depicted an entire airport scene complete with a jumbo jet and massive crowd. They were understandably upset at the time, but also a little amazed. For him creating and working with wood has been an ideal creative outlet. Louis started woodworking as a teen in woodshop class. He always enjoyed it, but it was the bookcase he made from solid black walnut that really hooked him for life. He would enter many careers, including mechanical engineering and teaching to provide for his family, but always hoped to return to his beloved woodworking once he retired. Together they each complement one another well- youth and experience, traditional craftmanship and modern design. “Including the two of us there are three other team members making it a 5 person operation. We use a lot of common US hardwoods, and softwoods but also reclaimed woods like Douglas Fir. Reclaimed or salvaged wood is not only eco-friendly but it’s much more stable and dry and it looks great! With the hardwoods we like to use a lot of Alder, Ash, Poplar, Cherry, Maple, Mahogany, White Oak, and Walnut.” – Louis When it comes to home furnishings there’s no shortage of options but if you’re like a lot of people you may find yourself in either camp A or B. Camp A.) you’ve looked all over and nothing’s impressed you, you want something different. Or Camp B.) you’ve seen something you like, but it’s not the right size or it’s just a picture. Either way you’ve come to the right place, and this may be the best decision you’ve made this week! “We’re going to make you an heirloom. One of those rare things that gets better with age. Something bragworthy and unique that will improve your home’s everyday ambiance. And as a wise man once said, improving your surroundings is a great starting point for reaching other goals.” Former Santa Clarita Office The shop Rendering for a custom table ourpro

We would without doubt recommend her!” - Gen R.“Sarah was so sweet during our session.

You appeared to fit in with the others but secretly felt different. Maybe you felt that the world around you was somehow conscious and aware of your presence. Maybe while others around you consumed plant medicines and sacred molecules for recreation, you held back knowing intuitively that there was a different way. Or maybe the first time you tried a plant medicine, others were carrying on with the party but you suddenly knew that there was sentience all around you. It was in that moment, you understood that you were right all along.

She gave me an undestanding of how to use this powerful, natural medicine for deep healing from a psychological, physical, spiritual and any other concerns. She has a gentle kind way of teaching and created a warmth and connection for all of us over Zoom! I highly recommend her trainings. Kim T. MA. Psychotherapist I can’t think of a person in the world I trust more than Sarah as a friend and a guide. My time with her was life-changing in the most profound ways. Noel B. Journalist “Sarah is a gift to this world and anyone who is lucky enough to cross her path. I was called to her long before I knew her, her name or the medicine healing she sacredly provides. I was about 10 years into my healing journey through mainstream modalities without any significant change, ultimately worse off than I ever had been before. With the continual message that it was a life long diagnosis of suffering with no remedy. I started working with her and she gave me hope, breath and eventually life by guiding me back home to myself. Where I can access my own magic, resources and healing. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined living the life I am today. Sarah holds the magic and wisdoms of teachings long forgotten but desperately needed. She embodies the great mother energy. The pool of knowledge, resources and experience she holds is infinite in the power to heal. I am eternally grateful for her and everything thing she is.

I’ve advised urban leaders from around the world how to make their cities great. I come from a working class, union family. I put my kid through Portland Public Schools. I co-founded a successful business in my Southeast Portland neighborhood. I’ve spent a decade fighting to achieve Portland’s potential through local government action. I’m not a politician, and I’m running a campaign free of big money corruption. I love this city, but Portland’s shared vision of a sustainable, livable hometown is slipping from view. The current Mayor’s record is full of broken promises on solutions for houselessness and inequality. He’s shown no leadership on civil unrest or public safety. On his watch, things keep getting worse. It’s time for a change. I’m offering a progressive alternative. If you choose me as your Mayor, I’m ready to enact community-led plans to clean up the mess we’re in and achieve our potential. This city is on the verge of greatness, or continued decline. I believe that we will win. Portland, this is our chance. I’m asking for your vote. Let’s build a brighter future together.

View Judges View Winners 2024 Winners Winners of our 2024 edition View Past Winners Testimonials Being a medal winner at the LSC has had a significant impact on our sales. One of our business goals for the year was to gain more traction in the on-trade. Recognition from LSC has acted as a seal of approval in this respect as the competition is judged by some of the world's leading figures from the hospitality sector. This includes a listing with a high-end UK-wide department store whose buyer was on the judging panel. This also includes the opening up of a new export market after we were approached by an importer who had seen coverage of our success. This is no coincidence. The LSC team did a superb job of promoting the competition and providing a platform for the medal winners. North Uist Distillery Co "Retailers and wholesalers who were 'indifferent' to our products are now queuing up at ‘our door'.

Heaven's Door "Winning a Gold medal and Best Package really is fantastic! I and my wife have worked on the project for over 2 and a half years, so it really is amazing to get such positive feedback after working so hard on this project." - Mallorca Distillery Mallorca Distillery Gordon Chalmers, Head Distiller and Co-owner of Tamborine Mountain Distillery, Queensland, Australia, shares his opinion on the London Spirits Competition: “Only one word needed: fantastic!” Tamborine Mountain Distillery The London Spirits Competition provided us with an independent evaluation of our products and invaluable feedback about tasting notes. We were happy with the individualized feedback and care taken by organizers to ensure products arrived on time and were given the attention they deserved. We will definitely enter again. “Winning Gold medals at the London Spirits Competition has proven to be a powerful mechanism to attract international buyers to Headlands’ products. This triggered us to advertise medals through online and print media to promote the Headlands’ portfolio and further illustrate the unique selling points of our products. “With international food and spirits awards proliferating, it can become unclear what the worth of a gold medal is.

Home Insurance Coverage Video Resources FAQ Contact Select Page Sober Living Home Insurance Affordable and Comprehensive Insurance coverage tailored for owners of sober living homes Quote now ; Sober Living Operators have their own unique exposures when it comes to insurance. Most incorrectly believe that standard homeowner/landlord insurance policies will cover them and their business. They could not be more wrong! A sober living home is a business and needs proper insurance. Not only is there liability and property exposure but there is also professional liability, workers compensation, and sexual and physical harassment exposure.. add it all up and you have a need for a comprehensive commercial policy. The good news: You have come to the right place! Simply click on the Get Quote button and let our agents get you the right coverage at the right price! Quote now Commercial Liability Even though you may only have a few tenants, there are always uncertainties. We help provide the best risk management advice to protect your business and assets. Liability could protect you from the acts of your tenants as well as guests. Property Coverage Whether you own or rent the home, there is a good chance you need to insure it. Even more importantly is that coverage may also include loss of rents in the event of a covered claim. That coverage alone could save you from financial ruin! Business Auto – Non-Owned Auto If you have a business vehicle then we can help, however, if you have a house manager use their own car and do a few errands for the home you may have an exposure. We can add hired/non owner coverage to protect the operator in the event an employee drives their own car in the name of the business. Professional Liability – Errors and Omissions Perhaps the most misunderstood and under-utilized coverage for a Sober Living Home is professional liability. It is also known as Errors and Omission (E&O). Most of your tenants have come to you because they have relied on your advice or expertise. The reliance on your expertise creates possible exposure that only this coverage can provide. Often, we are told that there is simply a standard tenant landlord relationship. But that does not hold up when there are morning rituals, counseling, trips to 12 step and more. To protect your business and income, you need to have professional liability Sexual & Physical Harassment Sober living homes are not immune to possible tenant harassment by managers or other tenants. There can lapses of judgment or sobriety that can result in a lawsuit being slapped on the owner or operator regardless of how well they know the manager and tenants. Coverage from some carriers is mandatory in some states due to the litigious exposure. Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance plays an important role in a sober living environment. A data breach with HIPPA law information could require out of pocket expenses as well as payments to third parties who may sue for damages. We can review and determine what your individual needs are. Workers Compensation Workers compensation for sober living homes covers employees inured on the job or for work related illnesses. Additional exposure for those that have vehicles whether owned by the company or individually by the employee. Umbrella – Excess Umbrella insurance provides additional layers of protection to your existing insurance policies. Some third parties will require higher limits than standard policies provide.. We’ll help find the right solution to cover all your business needs Quote now Coping with Challenges in Sober Living Operations: Top Ten Concerns and Solutions Feb 20, 2024Operating a sober living home involves navigating a complex web of legal, ethical, and medical responsibilities. Insurance is a critical component in ensuring that you are protected against the array of risks associated with this type of care facility. Below are some... read more Essential Checklist to Safeguard Your Sober Living Home from Liability Claims F

The cold front that impacted the Daytona 500 on Sunday is forecasted to turn into a stationary front & remain over the Gulf through Sunday. Looking ahead to Friday, an upper-level shortwave trough is forecasted to setup over the Western US. It is forecasted to slowly move Eastward throughout the weekend. Friday should remain clear as a surface high-pressure system sits over the Midwest. By Saturday, the shortwave trough is forecasted to move over the Southern Plains, driving the creation of a surface low-pressure system over the Gulf. This low-pressure system will move the stationary front further North, turning it into a warm front throughout the day. This shortwave trough has slowly been getting weaker and weaker as model runs have progressed throughout the week. It has also been forecasted to move further South than previously forecasted. This should lead to no chances of rain on Saturday & Sunday!We will continue to update the forecast throughout the week!Updated February 20, 2025, 11:00 AM EDT AdvertisingSpace Available HAMPTON, GA WEATHER AdvertisingSpace Available More about Atlanta Motor Speedway Atlanta Motor Speedway (formerly known Atlanta International Raceway from 1960 to 1990) is a 1.54-mile entertainment facility in Hampton, Georgia, United States, 20 miles (32 km) south of Atlanta. It has annually hosted NASCAR Cup Series stock car races since its inauguration in 1960.The venue was bought by Speedway Motorsports in 1990. In 1994, 46 condominiums were built over the northeastern side of the track. In 1997, to standardize the track with Speedway Motorsports’ other two intermediate ovals, the entire track was almost completely rebuilt. The frontstretch and backstretch were swapped, and the configuration of the track was changed from oval to quad-oval, with a new official length of 1.54-mile (2.48 km) where before it was 1.522-mile (2.449 km). The project made the track one of the fastest on the NASCAR circuit. In July 2021 NASCAR announced that the track would be reprofiled for the 2022 season to have 28 degrees (previously 24 degrees) of banking and would be narrowed from 55 to 40 feet which makes racing at the track similar to restrictor plate superspeedways. As a result, superspeedway rules are used at the track, despite being significantly shorter than Daytona or Talladega. It is now the most steeply banked mile and a half track in America. Despite the reprofiling being criticized by drivers, construction began in August 2021 and wrapped up in December 2021. The track has seating capacity of 71,000 to 125,000 people depending on the tracks configuration.To learn about sponsorship opportunities in NASCAR Cup Series Race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, visit EC Sports Management.Click here to contact their sales team. ““Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement.” – Ray Lewis About RaceWeather AboutAdvertisePartnersPressContact Us ExoConsulting About ExoConsulting, LLCChesapeake AnalyticsEC Sports Management 0 0 Skip to Content NASCAR About Us Insights Contact Us Open Menu Close M

View Judges View Winners 2024 Winners Winners of our 2024 edition View Past Winners Testimonials Being a medal winner at the LSC has had a significant impact on our sales. One of our business goals for the year was to gain more traction in the on-trade. Recognition from LSC has acted as a seal of approval in this respect as the competition is judged by some of the world's leading figures from the hospitality sector. This includes a listing with a high-end UK-wide department store whose buyer was on the judging panel. This also includes the opening up of a new export market after we were approached by an importer who had seen coverage of our success. This is no coincidence. The LSC team did a superb job of promoting the competition and providing a platform for the medal winners. North Uist Distillery Co "Retailers and wholesalers who were 'indifferent' to our products are now queuing up at ‘our door'. The curiosity it has caused amongst the trade and public has increased our sales dramatically. Finally, the award has caused BBC South Today and BBC Radio Oxford to interview us, giving even greater exposure." - Chalgrove Artisan Distillery Chalgrove Artisan Distillery "We were thrilled not just for the recognition, but because it comes from a comprehensively considered competition that aims to reward whiskeys that are high quality and attractively packaged." - Andrea Myers, Vice President of Marketing for Heaven's Door. Heaven's Door "Winning a Gold medal and Best Package really is fantastic! I and my wife have worked on the project for over 2 and a half years, so it really is amazing to get such positive feedback after working so hard on this project." - Mallorca Distillery Mallorca Distillery Gordon Chalmers, Head Distiller and Co-owner of Tamborine Mountain Distillery, Queensland, Australia, shares his opinion on the London Spirits Competition: “Only one word needed: fantastic!” Tamborine Mountain Distillery The London Spirits Competition provided us with an independent evaluation of our products and invaluable feedback about tasting notes. We were happy with the individualized feedback and care taken by organizers to ensure products arrived on time and were given the attention they deserved. We will definitely enter again. “Winning Gold medals at the London Spirits Competition has proven to be a powerful mechanism to attract international buyers to Headlands’ products. This triggered us to advertise medals through online and print media to promote the Headlands’ portfolio and further illustrate the unique selling points of our products. “With international food and spirits awards proliferating, it can become unclear what the worth of a gold medal is.

The cold front that impacted the Daytona 500 on Sunday is forecasted to turn into a stationary front & remain over the Gulf through Sunday. Looking ahead to Friday, an upper-level shortwave trough is forecasted to setup over the Western US. It is forecasted to slowly move Eastward throughout the weekend. Friday should remain clear as a surface high-pressure system sits over the Midwest. By Saturday, the shortwave trough is forecasted to move over the Southern Plains, driving the creation of a surface low-pressure system over the Gulf. This low-pressure system will move the stationary front further North, turning it into a warm front throughout the day. This shortwave trough has slowly been getting weaker and weaker as model runs have progressed throughout the week. It has also been forecasted to move further South than previously forecasted. This should lead to no chances of rain on Saturday & Sunday!We will continue to update the forecast throughout the week!Updated February 20, 2025, 11:00 AM EDT AdvertisingSpace Available HAMPTON, GA WEATHER AdvertisingSpace Available More about Atlanta Motor Speedway Atlanta Motor Speedway (formerly known Atlanta International Raceway from 1960 to 1990) is a 1.54-mile entertainment facility in Hampton, Georgia, United States, 20 miles (32 km) south of Atlanta. It has annually hosted NASCAR Cup Series stock car races since its inauguration in 1960.The venue was bought by Speedway Motorsports in 1990. In 1994, 46 condominiums were built over the northeastern side of the track. In 1997, to standardize the track with Speedway Motorsports’ other two intermediate ovals, the entire track was almost completely rebuilt. The frontstretch and backstretch were swapped, and the configuration of the track was changed from oval to quad-oval, with a new official length of 1.54-mile (2.48 km) where before it was 1.522-mile (2.449 km). The project made the track one of the fastest on the NASCAR circuit. In July 2021 NASCAR announced that the track would be reprofiled for the 2022 season to have 28 degrees (previously 24 degrees) of banking and would be narrowed from 55 to 40 feet which makes racing at the track similar to restrictor plate superspeedways. As a result, superspeedway rules are used at the track, despite being significantly shorter than Daytona or Talladega. It is now the most steeply banked mile and a half track in America. Despite the reprofiling being criticized by drivers, construction began in August 2021 and wrapped up in December 2021. The track has seating capacity of 71,000 to 125,000 people depending on the tracks configuration.To learn about sponsorship opportunities in NASCAR Cup Series Race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, visit EC Sports Management.Click here to contact their sales team. ““Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement.” – Ray Lewis About RaceWeather AboutAdvertisePartnersPressContact Us ExoConsulting About ExoConsulting, LLCChesapeake AnalyticsEC Sports Management 0 0 Skip to Content NASCAR About Us Insights Contact Us Open Menu Close M

Home Insurance Coverage Video Resources FAQ Contact Select Page Sober Living Home Insurance Affordable and Comprehensive Insurance coverage tailored for owners of sober living homes Quote now ; Sober Living Operators have their own unique exposures when it comes to insurance. Most incorrectly believe that standard homeowner/landlord insurance policies will cover them and their business. They could not be more wrong! A sober living home is a business and needs proper insurance. Not only is there liability and property exposure but there is also professional liability, workers compensation, and sexual and physical harassment exposure.. add it all up and you have a need for a comprehensive commercial policy. The good news: You have come to the right place! Simply click on the Get Quote button and let our agents get you the right coverage at the right price! Quote now Commercial Liability Even though you may only have a few tenants, there are always uncertainties. We help provide the best risk management advice to protect your business and assets. Liability could protect you from the acts of your tenants as well as guests. Property Coverage Whether you own or rent the home, there is a good chance you need to insure it. Even more importantly is that coverage may also include loss of rents in the event of a covered claim. That coverage alone could save you from financial ruin! Business Auto – Non-Owned Auto If you have a business vehicle then we can help, however, if you have a house manager use their own car and do a few errands for the home you may have an exposure. We can add hired/non owner coverage to protect the operator in the event an employee drives their own car in the name of the business. Professional Liability – Errors and Omissions Perhaps the most misunderstood and under-utilized coverage for a Sober Living Home is professional liability. It is also known as Errors and Omission (E&O). Most of your tenants have come to you because they have relied on your advice or expertise. The reliance on your expertise creates possible exposure that only this coverage can provide. Often, we are told that there is simply a standard tenant landlord relationship. But that does not hold up when there are morning rituals, counseling, trips to 12 step and more. To protect your business and income, you need to have professional liability Sexual & Physical Harassment Sober living homes are not immune to possible tenant harassment by managers or other tenants. There can lapses of judgment or sobriety that can result in a lawsuit being slapped on the owner or operator regardless of how well they know the manager and tenants. Coverage from some carriers is mandatory in some states due to the litigious exposure. Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance plays an important role in a sober living environment. A data breach with HIPPA law information could require out of pocket expenses as well as payments to third parties who may sue for damages. We can review and determine what your individual needs are. Workers Compensation Workers compensation for sober living homes covers employees inured on the job or for work related illnesses. Additional exposure for those that have vehicles whether owned by the company or individually by the employee. Umbrella – Excess Umbrella insurance provides additional layers of protection to your existing insurance policies. Some third parties will require higher limits than standard policies provide.. We’ll help find the right solution to cover all your business needs Quote now Coping with Challenges in Sober Living Operations: Top Ten Concerns and Solutions Feb 20, 2024Operating a sober living home involves navigating a complex web of legal, ethical, and medical responsibilities. Insurance is a critical component in ensuring that you are protected against the array of risks associated with this type of care facility. Below are some... read more Essential Checklist to Safeguard Your Sober Living Home from Liability Claims F

Reserveer dan jouw vakantie!Bed and Breakfast Arganil | Centraal Portugal Ja wij willen komen genieten in Bed & Breakfast Casa Traca!Sinds mei 2016 heet ik mijn gasten van harte welkom in mijn kleinschalige bed & breakfast Arganil (Valbona), in het groene hart van Centraal Portugal. Casa Traca is een kleinschalige en informele Bed and Breakfast in midden Portugal. Een rustige plek weg van het massa toerisme maar toch centraal gelegen in de gemeente Arganil, Coimbra. Bij B&B Casa Traca staat genieten voorop. Genieten van dit mooie land in al haar facetten. Genieten van het niets hoeven, onthaasten en ontstressen. Dit gevoel van thuiskomen op vakantie wil ik mijn gasten graag meegeven! De tuin, met haar vele loungeplekken, staat geheel ter beschikking voor jullie, mijn gasten. B&B Casa Traca ligt halverwege de de berg Monte' Alto . Vanuit de tuin wandelt u zo naar de top van de berg met de prachtige kapel en het fabuleuze uitzicht. Casa Traca beschikt over 4 royale themakamers waar u heerlijk tot rust kan komen, na bijvoorbeeld een vakantiedag naar de watervallen van Fraga da Pena en het leistenendorp Píodão. Gelegen in het beschermde natuurgebied van Serra do Açor; Serra do Açor Protected Landscape . Ik hanteer het hele jaar door dezelfde prijzen. Zo heeft u ook in het hoogseizoen een betaalbare vakantie in onze accommodatie in Arganil om te ontspannen en te genieten! Vanaf € 65,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 2 volwassenen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 60,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 tot 3 personen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 60,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 tot 4 personen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 55,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 of 2 personen Boek deze kamerDe ligging van Valbona Bed and Breakfast Casa Traca is gelegen bij Arganil, in centraal Portugal, op ongeveer 40 minuten afstand van Coimbra, de oude universiteitsstad. U vindt Casa Traca in het authentieke dorpje Valbona. In Valbona lijkt de tijd te hebben stilgestaan. Er is een kleine dorpswinkel annex café. Er zijn bossen om heerlijke wandelingen te maken, bergen voor de prachtigste bergtochten met de auto of de motor. Rivieren om te zwemmen en te kayakken, watervallen om te genieten van de kracht van de natuur. Ook een dagje strand aan de Atlantische Oceaan is geen probleem: Figueira da Foz ligt op een uurtje rijden. Bed and Breakfast Casa Traca in Arganil maakt onderdeel uit van de Serra do Açor Protected Landscape. Casa Traca is hiervoor aangesloten bij de organisatie Natural.pt /ICNF Portugal. Middels deze samenwerking doe ik actief mee aan het behoud van de Serra do Açor als beschermd natuurgebied

Installment Loans: Complete Guide on Types, Benefits, and Application ProcessFor personal finance, a reliable partner is vital for borrowers who want beneficial financial solutions. It is important to learn about installment loans fully to empower borrowers with financial tools that can empower them to fulfill their diverse needs.According to a recent study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), individuals who grasp the fundamentals of installment loans are more likely to manage their finances effectively and avoid common pitfalls.Let’s check out what experts of Cascade Springs Loan have to tell you about installment loans.What Are Installment Loans?At its core, an installment loan is a straightforward financial tool. It’s a sum of money borrowed from a lender that you repay in fixed, regular installments over an agreed-upon period. Each payment covers both the principal amount and interest, providing clarity on your repayment schedule.The mechanics are simple. When you take out an installment loan, you receive a lump sum. You then commit to repaying this amount, plus interest, in fixed portions over the loan term. Monthly payments remain consistent, making budgeting more manageable.Installment loans serve various purposes. They’re often employed for significant expenses like home repairs, medical bills, or unexpected emergencies. Additionally, they can be used for planned investments, such as education or home improvement. The flexibility of installment loans makes them a practical choice for navigating life’s financial challenges with predictability.Types of Installment LoansPayday loans are short-term loans designed to cover immediate expenses until your next paycheck. They typically involve smaller amounts and shorter repayment periods compared to other installment loans.Features and Eligibility CriteriaSpeed: Quick approval and disbursement, often within a day.Eligibility: Usually requires proof of income, a checking account, and identification.Amount: Generally smaller amounts based on your income.Pros and ConsPros:Immediate financial relief.Minimal documentation.Cons:Higher interest rates.Short repayment period can lead to a cycle of borrowing.Installment loans are a more flexible borrowing option. They involve borrowing a lump sum and repaying it in fixed, regular installments over a more extended period.Features and BenefitsPredictable Payments: Monthly payments remain consistent, aiding in budgeting.Higher Amounts: Generally, installment loans allow for larger loan amounts.Extended Terms: Longer repayment periods, providing more time to repay.Wondering how it differs from payday loans? Here are some main variations:Repayment Structure: Paying back in fixed installments over a more extended period.Amount and Terms: Typically involves larger amounts and more extended repayment terms compared to payday loans.Interest Rates: While interest rates vary, they are often more reasonable than payday loans.Understanding the distinctions between payday loans and installment loans empowers borrowers to choose the option that aligns best with their financial needs.Secured vs. Unsecured Installment LoansSecured installment loans involve providing collateral, which is an asset that acts as security for the loan. This can be anything from a vehicle to valuable possessions. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender can claim the collateral.AdvantagesLower Interest Rates: Secured loans often have lower interest rates due to the reduced risk for the lender.Higher Approval Odds: Collateral provides assurance, making approval more likely.DisadvantagesRisk of Asset Loss: Failing to repay could result in the loss of the collateral.Stricter Eligibility: Requirements may include a valuable asset, limiting accessibility for some.Unsecured installment loans do not require collateral. Approval is based on the borrower’s creditworthiness, income, and financial history.BenefitsNo Asset Risk: Borrowers don’t risk losing personal asse

Cause Craft is fluent in the strategy and tactics required for successful marketing and donor engagement in a digital world, and has helped us structure the team, right-size the tech investment, and articulate an approach to data and CRM that will help us bolster our fundraising and amplify MSF’s impact for years to come." Kim Goldsmith-N’Diaye, Director of DevelopmentMédecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders USA "The way that Cause Craft embeds with their clients is remarkable. They work so closely with our team and are so diligent in their approach that they feel like an extension of our staff. They're also nimble, scaling up their bench as needed and adapting plans mid-project to help us mitigate challenges as they emerge, while keeping us grounded in the outcomes we're looking to achieve. They have truly lived into their promise of getting "in the trenches" with us to ensure the best possible success for our organization." Elizabeth NielsenSVP of Digital & Direct MarketingFeeding America Misty McLaughlin and Alice Hendricks are among the most effective consultants with whom I’ve ever had the opportunity to work. Their knowledge of the digital space is unparalleled. One of the things I find most valuable about their counsel is that they pay attention to the particular details and needs of my organization and consistently provide right-sized advice and solutions. DeDe DunevantVP of CommunicationsPhysicians for Human Rights Working with Alice and Misty is like a master's class in marrying the needs of our organization with the needs of our constituents via an online experience. Unlike working with some other consultants, which can feel like paying someone to document what you already know but don't have time to do yourself, working with Misty and Alice is different: They always seem to find that insight that is a few steps further — and better — than what you already know.

Cats knead for different reasons. Nursing kittens knead to assist their mothers in producing milk. Adult cats who have been nursing kittens may also knead for comfort. However, some mature cats knead on their owner’s laps to express affection, while others knead, stimulating their sense glands to mark their territory. Why Do Cats Have Whiskers? Whiskas follicles are surrounded by sensory cells. These sensory cells guide cats through daily functions. It activates the cat’s sense of solid objects when touched, helping them to navigate the environment. Likewise, it also aids vision and is a medium for communication. Whiskas show movement when cats are stressed. Why Do Cats Wag Their Tails? Cats communicate their feelings by wagging their tails. If your cat thumps their tail, it implies that they are upset and something is irritating them. Similarly, twitching the end of the tail indicates that they are playing or hunting, but it could also indicate that your cat is moderately upset if they are not playing. If your cat is swinging its tail from side to side, it could indicate that they are paying attention to something. If your cat’s tail quivers, it suggests it is pleased to see you or another cat. Can Cats See in the Dark? Cats can see in low light conditions such as twilight, dawn, and dusk, but not in complete darkness. Because our homes are rarely entirely dark, there is always some light coming from someplace, which makes many believe that cats have night vision and can see in the dark, but in truth, they cannot see in complete darkness. Cats are crepuscular beings which means that they are more active when it’s twilight, such as when hunting for their prey at night. What is a group of cats called? The group of cats is known as a clowder or a glaring. If there are two cats, it is termed a pair, and if there are three or more cats, it is called a clowder. The word clowder comes from the word clodder in Middle English, which was introduced in the late

Our approach to address the Project’s numerous critical elements has been routinely implemented on other major urban and smaller local projects. Our Team will apply design-build management best practices to provide DC Water with a constructable design that incorporates optimal means and methods. Our past proven methods, protocols, and expertise will undoubtably confirm that we will deliver the highest value for money to DC Water and its customers.DC Water has over the past decade undertaken monumental steps and invested hundreds of millions of dollars upgrading the D.C. region’s water and sewer system. The Potomac River Tunnel (PRT) Project, the next major phase of the DC Clean Rivers Project, is distinct from previous projects as it stands out as one of the most challenging tunnel projects in the history of DC Water due to its sensitive location, technical complexity, and risky geological profile. We understand that it is essential for DC Water to carefully select a partner who will bring both unmatched technical expertise and proven experience successfully delivering world-class, major tunneling projects in dense urban environments.As an Equal Opportunity Employer, our team has an outstanding record for hiring, promoting, and retaining diverse, local workforces on our projects. CBNA achieved an 85% local ratio for the workforce on the challenging Port of Miami Tunnel Project and we plan to use the same approach to maximize local employment diversity and inclusion on the PRT Project. At Halmar, we source 90% or greater of local staff to work on our projects, and on average we achieve 40% of workforce diversity of the total project crew and offices. The CBNA Halmar Clean Rivers JV understands the importance of supporting, local, small, woman-owned, disadvantaged and minority businesses in the markets we serve. Our team is fully committed to participate in DC Water’s disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) and women-owned business enterprise (WBE) Contracting and Local Employment Compliance programs and meet and/or exceed the Fair Share Objective of 28% DBE and 4% WBE professional services component goal and 32% DBE and 6% WBE for the construction component of this project as part of our design, subcontracting and supplier opportunities. We place a significant value on their contributions as they are a fundamental in our approach to deliver a successful project, adding strength, skilled talent and expertise, and local resources to our team. CBNA PORT OF MIAMI TUNNEL ​ Constructed under a public-private partnership contract, the Port of Miami Tunnel links Watson Island to the Port of Miami, which was formerly served by a single highway. The new road is good for the economic development of the port zone and decongests downtown areas by removing the freight traffic that previously transited through the city.

One of our business goals for the year was to gain more traction in the on-trade. Recognition from LSC has acted as a seal of approval in this respect as the competition is judged by some of the world's leading figures from the hospitality sector. This includes a listing with a high-end UK-wide department store whose buyer was on the judging panel. This also includes the opening up of a new export market after we were approached by an importer who had seen coverage of our success. This is no coincidence. The LSC team did a superb job of promoting the competition and providing a platform for the medal winners. North Uist Distillery Co "Retailers and wholesalers who were 'indifferent' to our products are now queuing up at ‘our door'. The curiosity it has caused amongst the trade and public has increased our sales dramatically. Finally, the award has caused BBC South Today and BBC Radio Oxford to interview us, giving even greater exposure." - Chalgrove Artisan Distillery Chalgrove Artisan Distillery "We were thrilled not just for the recognition, but because it comes from a comprehensively considered competition that aims to reward whiskeys that are high quality and attractively packaged." - Andrea Myers, Vice President of Marketing for Heaven's Door.

I and my wife have worked on the project for over 2 and a half years, so it really is amazing to get such positive feedback after working so hard on this project." - Mallorca Distillery Mallorca Distillery Gordon Chalmers, Head Distiller and Co-owner of Tamborine Mountain Distillery, Queensland, Australia, shares his opinion on the London Spirits Competition: “Only one word needed: fantastic!” Tamborine Mountain Distillery The London Spirits Competition provided us with an independent evaluation of our products and invaluable feedback about tasting notes. We were happy with the individualized feedback and care taken by organizers to ensure products arrived on time and were given the attention they deserved. We will definitely enter again. “Winning Gold medals at the London Spirits Competition has proven to be a powerful mechanism to attract international buyers to Headlands’ products. This triggered us to advertise medals through online and print media to promote the Headlands’ portfolio and further illustrate the unique selling points of our products. “With international food and spirits awards proliferating, it can become unclear what the worth of a gold medal is.

Home Insurance Coverage Video Resources FAQ Contact Select Page Sober Living Home Insurance Affordable and Comprehensive Insurance coverage tailored for owners of sober living homes Quote now ; Sober Living Operators have their own unique exposures when it comes to insurance. Most incorrectly believe that standard homeowner/landlord insurance policies will cover them and their business. They could not be more wrong! A sober living home is a business and needs proper insurance. Not only is there liability and property exposure but there is also professional liability, workers compensation, and sexual and physical harassment exposure.. add it all up and you have a need for a comprehensive commercial policy. The good news: You have come to the right place! Simply click on the Get Quote button and let our agents get you the right coverage at the right price! Quote now Commercial Liability Even though you may only have a few tenants, there are always uncertainties. We help provide the best risk management advice to protect your business and assets. Liability could protect you from the acts of your tenants as well as guests. Property Coverage Whether you own or rent the home, there is a good chance you need to insure it. Even more importantly is that coverage may also include loss of rents in the event of a covered claim. That coverage alone could save you from financial ruin! Business Auto – Non-Owned Auto If you have a business vehicle then we can help, however, if you have a house manager use their own car and do a few errands for the home you may have an exposure. We can add hired/non owner coverage to protect the operator in the event an employee drives their own car in the name of the business. Professional Liability – Errors and Omissions Perhaps the most misunderstood and under-utilized coverage for a Sober Living Home is professional liability. It is also known as Errors and Omission (E&O). Most of your tenants have come to you because they have relied on your advice or expertise. The reliance on your expertise creates possible exposure that only this coverage can provide. Often, we are told that there is simply a standard tenant landlord relationship. But that does not hold up when there are morning rituals, counseling, trips to 12 step and more. To protect your business and income, you need to have professional liability Sexual & Physical Harassment Sober living homes are not immune to possible tenant harassment by managers or other tenants. There can lapses of judgment or sobriety that can result in a lawsuit being slapped on the owner or operator regardless of how well they know the manager and tenants. Coverage from some carriers is mandatory in some states due to the litigious exposure. Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance plays an important role in a sober living environment. A data breach with HIPPA law information could require out of pocket expenses as well as payments to third parties who may sue for damages. We can review and determine what your individual needs are. Workers Compensation Workers compensation for sober living homes covers employees inured on the job or for work related illnesses. Additional exposure for those that have vehicles whether owned by the company or individually by the employee. Umbrella – Excess Umbrella insurance provides additional layers of protection to your existing insurance policies. Some third parties will require higher limits than standard policies provide.. We’ll help find the right solution to cover all your business needs Quote now Coping with Challenges in Sober Living Operations: Top Ten Concerns and Solutions Feb 20, 2024Operating a sober living home involves navigating a complex web of legal, ethical, and medical responsibilities. Insurance is a critical component in ensuring that you are protected against the array of risks associated with this type of care facility. Below are some... read more Essential Checklist to Safeguard Your Sober Living Home from Liability Claims F

The cold front that impacted the Daytona 500 on Sunday is forecasted to turn into a stationary front & remain over the Gulf through Sunday. Looking ahead to Friday, an upper-level shortwave trough is forecasted to setup over the Western US. It is forecasted to slowly move Eastward throughout the weekend. Friday should remain clear as a surface high-pressure system sits over the Midwest. By Saturday, the shortwave trough is forecasted to move over the Southern Plains, driving the creation of a surface low-pressure system over the Gulf. This low-pressure system will move the stationary front further North, turning it into a warm front throughout the day. This shortwave trough has slowly been getting weaker and weaker as model runs have progressed throughout the week. It has also been forecasted to move further South than previously forecasted. This should lead to no chances of rain on Saturday & Sunday!We will continue to update the forecast throughout the week!Updated February 20, 2025, 11:00 AM EDT AdvertisingSpace Available HAMPTON, GA WEATHER AdvertisingSpace Available More about Atlanta Motor Speedway Atlanta Motor Speedway (formerly known Atlanta International Raceway from 1960 to 1990) is a 1.54-mile entertainment facility in Hampton, Georgia, United States, 20 miles (32 km) south of Atlanta. It has annually hosted NASCAR Cup Series stock car races since its inauguration in 1960.The venue was bought by Speedway Motorsports in 1990. In 1994, 46 condominiums were built over the northeastern side of the track. In 1997, to standardize the track with Speedway Motorsports’ other two intermediate ovals, the entire track was almost completely rebuilt. The frontstretch and backstretch were swapped, and the configuration of the track was changed from oval to quad-oval, with a new official length of 1.54-mile (2.48 km) where before it was 1.522-mile (2.449 km). The project made the track one of the fastest on the NASCAR circuit. In July 2021 NASCAR announced that the track would be reprofiled for the 2022 season to have 28 degrees (previously 24 degrees) of banking and would be narrowed from 55 to 40 feet which makes racing at the track similar to restrictor plate superspeedways. As a result, superspeedway rules are used at the track, despite being significantly shorter than Daytona or Talladega. It is now the most steeply banked mile and a half track in America. Despite the reprofiling being criticized by drivers, construction began in August 2021 and wrapped up in December 2021. The track has seating capacity of 71,000 to 125,000 people depending on the tracks configuration.To learn about sponsorship opportunities in NASCAR Cup Series Race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, visit EC Sports Management.Click here to contact their sales team. ““Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement.” – Ray Lewis About RaceWeather AboutAdvertisePartnersPressContact Us ExoConsulting About ExoConsulting, LLCChesapeake AnalyticsEC Sports Management 0 0 Skip to Content NASCAR About Us Insights Contact Us Open Menu Close M

Reserveer dan jouw vakantie!Bed and Breakfast Arganil | Centraal Portugal Ja wij willen komen genieten in Bed & Breakfast Casa Traca!Sinds mei 2016 heet ik mijn gasten van harte welkom in mijn kleinschalige bed & breakfast Arganil (Valbona), in het groene hart van Centraal Portugal. Casa Traca is een kleinschalige en informele Bed and Breakfast in midden Portugal. Een rustige plek weg van het massa toerisme maar toch centraal gelegen in de gemeente Arganil, Coimbra. Bij B&B Casa Traca staat genieten voorop. Genieten van dit mooie land in al haar facetten. Genieten van het niets hoeven, onthaasten en ontstressen. Dit gevoel van thuiskomen op vakantie wil ik mijn gasten graag meegeven! De tuin, met haar vele loungeplekken, staat geheel ter beschikking voor jullie, mijn gasten. B&B Casa Traca ligt halverwege de de berg Monte' Alto . Vanuit de tuin wandelt u zo naar de top van de berg met de prachtige kapel en het fabuleuze uitzicht. Casa Traca beschikt over 4 royale themakamers waar u heerlijk tot rust kan komen, na bijvoorbeeld een vakantiedag naar de watervallen van Fraga da Pena en het leistenendorp Píodão. Gelegen in het beschermde natuurgebied van Serra do Açor; Serra do Açor Protected Landscape . Ik hanteer het hele jaar door dezelfde prijzen. Zo heeft u ook in het hoogseizoen een betaalbare vakantie in onze accommodatie in Arganil om te ontspannen en te genieten! Vanaf € 65,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 2 volwassenen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 60,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 tot 3 personen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 60,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 tot 4 personen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 55,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 of 2 personen Boek deze kamerDe ligging van Valbona Bed and Breakfast Casa Traca is gelegen bij Arganil, in centraal Portugal, op ongeveer 40 minuten afstand van Coimbra, de oude universiteitsstad. U vindt Casa Traca in het authentieke dorpje Valbona. In Valbona lijkt de tijd te hebben stilgestaan. Er is een kleine dorpswinkel annex café. Er zijn bossen om heerlijke wandelingen te maken, bergen voor de prachtigste bergtochten met de auto of de motor. Rivieren om te zwemmen en te kayakken, watervallen om te genieten van de kracht van de natuur. Ook een dagje strand aan de Atlantische Oceaan is geen probleem: Figueira da Foz ligt op een uurtje rijden. Bed and Breakfast Casa Traca in Arganil maakt onderdeel uit van de Serra do Açor Protected Landscape. Casa Traca is hiervoor aangesloten bij de organisatie Natural.pt /ICNF Portugal. Middels deze samenwerking doe ik actief mee aan het behoud van de Serra do Açor als beschermd natuurgebied

Installment Loans: Complete Guide on Types, Benefits, and Application ProcessFor personal finance, a reliable partner is vital for borrowers who want beneficial financial solutions. It is important to learn about installment loans fully to empower borrowers with financial tools that can empower them to fulfill their diverse needs.According to a recent study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), individuals who grasp the fundamentals of installment loans are more likely to manage their finances effectively and avoid common pitfalls.Let’s check out what experts of Cascade Springs Loan have to tell you about installment loans.What Are Installment Loans?At its core, an installment loan is a straightforward financial tool. It’s a sum of money borrowed from a lender that you repay in fixed, regular installments over an agreed-upon period. Each payment covers both the principal amount and interest, providing clarity on your repayment schedule.The mechanics are simple. When you take out an installment loan, you receive a lump sum. You then commit to repaying this amount, plus interest, in fixed portions over the loan term. Monthly payments remain consistent, making budgeting more manageable.Installment loans serve various purposes. They’re often employed for significant expenses like home repairs, medical bills, or unexpected emergencies. Additionally, they can be used for planned investments, such as education or home improvement. The flexibility of installment loans makes them a practical choice for navigating life’s financial challenges with predictability.Types of Installment LoansPayday loans are short-term loans designed to cover immediate expenses until your next paycheck. They typically involve smaller amounts and shorter repayment periods compared to other installment loans.Features and Eligibility CriteriaSpeed: Quick approval and disbursement, often within a day.Eligibility: Usually requires proof of income, a checking account, and identification.Amount: Generally smaller amounts based on your income.Pros and ConsPros:Immediate financial relief.Minimal documentation.Cons:Higher interest rates.Short repayment period can lead to a cycle of borrowing.Installment loans are a more flexible borrowing option. They involve borrowing a lump sum and repaying it in fixed, regular installments over a more extended period.Features and BenefitsPredictable Payments: Monthly payments remain consistent, aiding in budgeting.Higher Amounts: Generally, installment loans allow for larger loan amounts.Extended Terms: Longer repayment periods, providing more time to repay.Wondering how it differs from payday loans? Here are some main variations:Repayment Structure: Paying back in fixed installments over a more extended period.Amount and Terms: Typically involves larger amounts and more extended repayment terms compared to payday loans.Interest Rates: While interest rates vary, they are often more reasonable than payday loans.Understanding the distinctions between payday loans and installment loans empowers borrowers to choose the option that aligns best with their financial needs.Secured vs. Unsecured Installment LoansSecured installment loans involve providing collateral, which is an asset that acts as security for the loan. This can be anything from a vehicle to valuable possessions. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender can claim the collateral.AdvantagesLower Interest Rates: Secured loans often have lower interest rates due to the reduced risk for the lender.Higher Approval Odds: Collateral provides assurance, making approval more likely.DisadvantagesRisk of Asset Loss: Failing to repay could result in the loss of the collateral.Stricter Eligibility: Requirements may include a valuable asset, limiting accessibility for some.Unsecured installment loans do not require collateral. Approval is based on the borrower’s creditworthiness, income, and financial history.BenefitsNo Asset Risk: Borrowers don’t risk losing personal asse

Reserveer dan jouw vakantie!Bed and Breakfast Arganil | Centraal Portugal Ja wij willen komen genieten in Bed & Breakfast Casa Traca!Sinds mei 2016 heet ik mijn gasten van harte welkom in mijn kleinschalige bed & breakfast Arganil (Valbona), in het groene hart van Centraal Portugal. Casa Traca is een kleinschalige en informele Bed and Breakfast in midden Portugal. Een rustige plek weg van het massa toerisme maar toch centraal gelegen in de gemeente Arganil, Coimbra. Bij B&B Casa Traca staat genieten voorop. Genieten van dit mooie land in al haar facetten. Genieten van het niets hoeven, onthaasten en ontstressen. Dit gevoel van thuiskomen op vakantie wil ik mijn gasten graag meegeven! De tuin, met haar vele loungeplekken, staat geheel ter beschikking voor jullie, mijn gasten. B&B Casa Traca ligt halverwege de de berg Monte' Alto . Vanuit de tuin wandelt u zo naar de top van de berg met de prachtige kapel en het fabuleuze uitzicht. Casa Traca beschikt over 4 royale themakamers waar u heerlijk tot rust kan komen, na bijvoorbeeld een vakantiedag naar de watervallen van Fraga da Pena en het leistenendorp Píodão. Gelegen in het beschermde natuurgebied van Serra do Açor; Serra do Açor Protected Landscape . Ik hanteer het hele jaar door dezelfde prijzen. Zo heeft u ook in het hoogseizoen een betaalbare vakantie in onze accommodatie in Arganil om te ontspannen en te genieten! Vanaf € 65,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 2 volwassenen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 60,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 tot 3 personen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 60,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 tot 4 personen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 55,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 of 2 personen Boek deze kamerDe ligging van Valbona Bed and Breakfast Casa Traca is gelegen bij Arganil, in centraal Portugal, op ongeveer 40 minuten afstand van Coimbra, de oude universiteitsstad. U vindt Casa Traca in het authentieke dorpje Valbona. In Valbona lijkt de tijd te hebben stilgestaan. Er is een kleine dorpswinkel annex café. Er zijn bossen om heerlijke wandelingen te maken, bergen voor de prachtigste bergtochten met de auto of de motor. Rivieren om te zwemmen en te kayakken, watervallen om te genieten van de kracht van de natuur. Ook een dagje strand aan de Atlantische Oceaan is geen probleem: Figueira da Foz ligt op een uurtje rijden. Bed and Breakfast Casa Traca in Arganil maakt onderdeel uit van de Serra do Açor Protected Landscape. Casa Traca is hiervoor aangesloten bij de organisatie Natural.pt /ICNF Portugal. Middels deze samenwerking doe ik actief mee aan het behoud van de Serra do Açor als beschermd natuurgebied

Installment Loans: Complete Guide on Types, Benefits, and Application ProcessFor personal finance, a reliable partner is vital for borrowers who want beneficial financial solutions. It is important to learn about installment loans fully to empower borrowers with financial tools that can empower them to fulfill their diverse needs.According to a recent study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), individuals who grasp the fundamentals of installment loans are more likely to manage their finances effectively and avoid common pitfalls.Let’s check out what experts of Cascade Springs Loan have to tell you about installment loans.What Are Installment Loans?At its core, an installment loan is a straightforward financial tool. It’s a sum of money borrowed from a lender that you repay in fixed, regular installments over an agreed-upon period. Each payment covers both the principal amount and interest, providing clarity on your repayment schedule.The mechanics are simple. When you take out an installment loan, you receive a lump sum. You then commit to repaying this amount, plus interest, in fixed portions over the loan term. Monthly payments remain consistent, making budgeting more manageable.Installment loans serve various purposes. They’re often employed for significant expenses like home repairs, medical bills, or unexpected emergencies. Additionally, they can be used for planned investments, such as education or home improvement. The flexibility of installment loans makes them a practical choice for navigating life’s financial challenges with predictability.Types of Installment LoansPayday loans are short-term loans designed to cover immediate expenses until your next paycheck. They typically involve smaller amounts and shorter repayment periods compared to other installment loans.Features and Eligibility CriteriaSpeed: Quick approval and disbursement, often within a day.Eligibility: Usually requires proof of income, a checking account, and identification.Amount: Generally smaller amounts based on your income.Pros and ConsPros:Immediate financial relief.Minimal documentation.Cons:Higher interest rates.Short repayment period can lead to a cycle of borrowing.Installment loans are a more flexible borrowing option. They involve borrowing a lump sum and repaying it in fixed, regular installments over a more extended period.Features and BenefitsPredictable Payments: Monthly payments remain consistent, aiding in budgeting.Higher Amounts: Generally, installment loans allow for larger loan amounts.Extended Terms: Longer repayment periods, providing more time to repay.Wondering how it differs from payday loans? Here are some main variations:Repayment Structure: Paying back in fixed installments over a more extended period.Amount and Terms: Typically involves larger amounts and more extended repayment terms compared to payday loans.Interest Rates: While interest rates vary, they are often more reasonable than payday loans.Understanding the distinctions between payday loans and installment loans empowers borrowers to choose the option that aligns best with their financial needs.Secured vs. Unsecured Installment LoansSecured installment loans involve providing collateral, which is an asset that acts as security for the loan. This can be anything from a vehicle to valuable possessions. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender can claim the collateral.AdvantagesLower Interest Rates: Secured loans often have lower interest rates due to the reduced risk for the lender.Higher Approval Odds: Collateral provides assurance, making approval more likely.DisadvantagesRisk of Asset Loss: Failing to repay could result in the loss of the collateral.Stricter Eligibility: Requirements may include a valuable asset, limiting accessibility for some.Unsecured installment loans do not require collateral. Approval is based on the borrower’s creditworthiness, income, and financial history.BenefitsNo Asset Risk: Borrowers don’t risk losing personal asse

Purchasing a vehicle is a significant financial commitment, and no one deserves to be stuck with a car, truck or RV that malfunctions or has serious defects.

Lemon law protection ensures that car manufacturers uphold their warranties and provide suitable remedies to the consumer.

Third generation woodworkers based in the Los Angeles area and specializing in custom woodwork. From tables and bookcases to bed frames and dressers, every piece is handcrafted and made to the highest standards. Along with the signature collection, fully custom projects are also welcomed. A rarity these days, but an important opportunity that has afforded us the chance to continually sharpen our skills. Over the past 10 plus years we’ve made not only custom furniture, but also built-ins, shelves, mantels, home goods, faux beams, and wall treatments. Basically, anything with wood you’ve seen on the show Fixer Upper. “We got going back in 2013, making small things for family and friends. But really, the true roots of the business go back much further than that. My grandfather was a master carpenter and cabinet maker. He was also a business owner and leader in his industry at a time when few Mexican- Americans were. He taught me carpentry and the importance of hard work. It was his influence that gave me the desire and belief in myself to start my own business someday.” -Steven Although really close the two are both very different people. Family members say Steven showed signs of artistic talent even at a very young age. In a story told countless times, his parents recall when as a toddler he covered an entire wall in crayon. This “mural” depicted an entire airport scene complete with a jumbo jet and massive crowd. They were understandably upset at the time, but also a little amazed. For him creating and working with wood has been an ideal creative outlet. Louis started woodworking as a teen in woodshop class. He always enjoyed it, but it was the bookcase he made from solid black walnut that really hooked him for life. He would enter many careers, including mechanical engineering and teaching to provide for his family, but always hoped to return to his beloved woodworking once he retired. Together they each complement one another well- youth and experience, traditional craftmanship and modern design. “Including the two of us there are three other team members making it a 5 person operation. We use a lot of common US hardwoods, and softwoods but also reclaimed woods like Douglas Fir. Reclaimed or salvaged wood is not only eco-friendly but it’s much more stable and dry and it looks great! With the hardwoods we like to use a lot of Alder, Ash, Poplar, Cherry, Maple, Mahogany, White Oak, and Walnut.” – Louis When it comes to home furnishings there’s no shortage of options but if you’re like a lot of people you may find yourself in either camp A or B. Camp A.) you’ve looked all over and nothing’s impressed you, you want something different. Or Camp B.) you’ve seen something you like, but it’s not the right size or it’s just a picture. Either way you’ve come to the right place, and this may be the best decision you’ve made this week! “We’re going to make you an heirloom. One of those rare things that gets better with age. Something bragworthy and unique that will improve your home’s everyday ambiance. And as a wise man once said, improving your surroundings is a great starting point for reaching other goals.” Former Santa Clarita Office The shop Rendering for a custom table ourpro

I was miserable, and other doctors couldn’t help me. Under the care of Dr. Doctor within 4 weeks I was itch-free. As time went on she helped address other health issues I was experiencing for years. Ana Kyani 2025-02-11 A life changing experience with Dr A life changing experience with Dr. Doctor I cannot say enough wonderful things about Dr. Doctor and my experience with her. From the very first visit, she took the time to truly listen to our concerns and develop a personalized treatment plan that worked wonders for both me and my daughter. Beyond her medical expertise, Dr. Doctor is warm, compassionate, and always makes us feel comfortable. She explains everything in detail and ensures we feel informed and empowered in our skincare journey. If you’re looking for a dermatologist who truly cares and delivers real results, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Doctor. She has made such a positive impact on our lives, and we are beyond grateful! Ana Burzin 2025-02-05 Great experience of Dr. Sanober’ s expertise. It tempts me to write that I had a great experience from Dr. Sanober Doctor consultation. I had almost lost my hair and was on verge of baldness. After consulting Dr. Sanober my hairfall stopped and baldness got reduced to major extent. I bless Dr. Sanober for timely treating my hairfall. God Bless. Get the personal attention you deserve. Book a private session with Dr. Sanober! I’ve been getting an overwhelming amount of people asking me to tell them what to use on their skin or help with preventing hair loss.I wish I could create a video and give everyone the same answer, but I can’t because your skin, hair, and body are UNIQUE to YOU! It would be irresponsible of me to make recommendations without knowing anything about you — and no, an online survey about your skin is not enough.I

Reserveer dan jouw vakantie!Bed and Breakfast Arganil | Centraal Portugal Ja wij willen komen genieten in Bed & Breakfast Casa Traca!Sinds mei 2016 heet ik mijn gasten van harte welkom in mijn kleinschalige bed & breakfast Arganil (Valbona), in het groene hart van Centraal Portugal. Casa Traca is een kleinschalige en informele Bed and Breakfast in midden Portugal. Een rustige plek weg van het massa toerisme maar toch centraal gelegen in de gemeente Arganil, Coimbra. Bij B&B Casa Traca staat genieten voorop. Genieten van dit mooie land in al haar facetten. Genieten van het niets hoeven, onthaasten en ontstressen. Dit gevoel van thuiskomen op vakantie wil ik mijn gasten graag meegeven! De tuin, met haar vele loungeplekken, staat geheel ter beschikking voor jullie, mijn gasten. B&B Casa Traca ligt halverwege de de berg Monte' Alto . Vanuit de tuin wandelt u zo naar de top van de berg met de prachtige kapel en het fabuleuze uitzicht. Casa Traca beschikt over 4 royale themakamers waar u heerlijk tot rust kan komen, na bijvoorbeeld een vakantiedag naar de watervallen van Fraga da Pena en het leistenendorp Píodão. Gelegen in het beschermde natuurgebied van Serra do Açor; Serra do Açor Protected Landscape . Ik hanteer het hele jaar door dezelfde prijzen. Zo heeft u ook in het hoogseizoen een betaalbare vakantie in onze accommodatie in Arganil om te ontspannen en te genieten! Vanaf € 65,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 2 volwassenen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 60,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 tot 3 personen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 60,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 tot 4 personen Boek deze kamer Vanaf € 55,00 per nacht Geschikt voor 1 of 2 personen Boek deze kamerDe ligging van Valbona Bed and Breakfast Casa Traca is gelegen bij Arganil, in centraal Portugal, op ongeveer 40 minuten afstand van Coimbra, de oude universiteitsstad. U vindt Casa Traca in het authentieke dorpje Valbona. In Valbona lijkt de tijd te hebben stilgestaan. Er is een kleine dorpswinkel annex café. Er zijn bossen om heerlijke wandelingen te maken, bergen voor de prachtigste bergtochten met de auto of de motor. Rivieren om te zwemmen en te kayakken, watervallen om te genieten van de kracht van de natuur. Ook een dagje strand aan de Atlantische Oceaan is geen probleem: Figueira da Foz ligt op een uurtje rijden. Bed and Breakfast Casa Traca in Arganil maakt onderdeel uit van de Serra do Açor Protected Landscape. Casa Traca is hiervoor aangesloten bij de organisatie Natural.pt /ICNF Portugal. Middels deze samenwerking doe ik actief mee aan het behoud van de Serra do Açor als beschermd natuurgebied

Installment Loans: Complete Guide on Types, Benefits, and Application ProcessFor personal finance, a reliable partner is vital for borrowers who want beneficial financial solutions. It is important to learn about installment loans fully to empower borrowers with financial tools that can empower them to fulfill their diverse needs.According to a recent study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), individuals who grasp the fundamentals of installment loans are more likely to manage their finances effectively and avoid common pitfalls.Let’s check out what experts of Cascade Springs Loan have to tell you about installment loans.What Are Installment Loans?At its core, an installment loan is a straightforward financial tool. It’s a sum of money borrowed from a lender that you repay in fixed, regular installments over an agreed-upon period. Each payment covers both the principal amount and interest, providing clarity on your repayment schedule.The mechanics are simple. When you take out an installment loan, you receive a lump sum. You then commit to repaying this amount, plus interest, in fixed portions over the loan term. Monthly payments remain consistent, making budgeting more manageable.Installment loans serve various purposes. They’re often employed for significant expenses like home repairs, medical bills, or unexpected emergencies. Additionally, they can be used for planned investments, such as education or home improvement. The flexibility of installment loans makes them a practical choice for navigating life’s financial challenges with predictability.Types of Installment LoansPayday loans are short-term loans designed to cover immediate expenses until your next paycheck. They typically involve smaller amounts and shorter repayment periods compared to other installment loans.Features and Eligibility CriteriaSpeed: Quick approval and disbursement, often within a day.Eligibility: Usually requires proof of income, a checking account, and identification.Amount: Generally smaller amounts based on your income.Pros and ConsPros:Immediate financial relief.Minimal documentation.Cons:Higher interest rates.Short repayment period can lead to a cycle of borrowing.Installment loans are a more flexible borrowing option. They involve borrowing a lump sum and repaying it in fixed, regular installments over a more extended period.Features and BenefitsPredictable Payments: Monthly payments remain consistent, aiding in budgeting.Higher Amounts: Generally, installment loans allow for larger loan amounts.Extended Terms: Longer repayment periods, providing more time to repay.Wondering how it differs from payday loans? Here are some main variations:Repayment Structure: Paying back in fixed installments over a more extended period.Amount and Terms: Typically involves larger amounts and more extended repayment terms compared to payday loans.Interest Rates: While interest rates vary, they are often more reasonable than payday loans.Understanding the distinctions between payday loans and installment loans empowers borrowers to choose the option that aligns best with their financial needs.Secured vs. Unsecured Installment LoansSecured installment loans involve providing collateral, which is an asset that acts as security for the loan. This can be anything from a vehicle to valuable possessions. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender can claim the collateral.AdvantagesLower Interest Rates: Secured loans often have lower interest rates due to the reduced risk for the lender.Higher Approval Odds: Collateral provides assurance, making approval more likely.DisadvantagesRisk of Asset Loss: Failing to repay could result in the loss of the collateral.Stricter Eligibility: Requirements may include a valuable asset, limiting accessibility for some.Unsecured installment loans do not require collateral. Approval is based on the borrower’s creditworthiness, income, and financial history.BenefitsNo Asset Risk: Borrowers don’t risk losing personal asse
