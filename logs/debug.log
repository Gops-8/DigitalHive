This triggered us to advertise medals through online and print media to promote the Headlands’ portfolio and further illustrate the unique selling points of our products. “With international food and spirits awards proliferating, it can become unclear what the worth of a gold medal is.

Home Insurance Coverage Video Resources FAQ Contact Select Page Sober Living Home Insurance Affordable and Comprehensive Insurance coverage tailored for owners of sober living homes Quote now ; Sober Living Operators have their own unique exposures when it comes to insurance. Most incorrectly believe that standard homeowner/landlord insurance policies will cover them and their business. They could not be more wrong! A sober living home is a business and needs proper insurance. Not only is there liability and property exposure but there is also professional liability, workers compensation, and sexual and physical harassment exposure.. add it all up and you have a need for a comprehensive commercial policy. The good news: You have come to the right place! Simply click on the Get Quote button and let our agents get you the right coverage at the right price! Quote now Commercial Liability Even though you may only have a few tenants, there are always uncertainties. We help provide the best risk management advice to protect your business and assets. Liability could protect you from the acts of your tenants as well as guests. Property Coverage Whether you own or rent the home, there is a good chance you need to insure it. Even more importantly is that coverage may also include loss of rents in the event of a covered claim. That coverage alone could save you from financial ruin! Business Auto – Non-Owned Auto If you have a business vehicle then we can help, however, if you have a house manager use their own car and do a few errands for the home you may have an exposure. We can add hired/non owner coverage to protect the operator in the event an employee drives their own car in the name of the business. Professional Liability – Errors and Omissions Perhaps the most misunderstood and under-utilized coverage for a Sober Living Home is professional liability. It is also known as Errors and Omission (E&O). Most of your tenants have come to you because they have relied on your advice or expertise. The reliance on your expertise creates possible exposure that only this coverage can provide. Often, we are told that there is simply a standard tenant landlord relationship. But that does not hold up when there are morning rituals, counseling, trips to 12 step and more. To protect your business and income, you need to have professional liability Sexual & Physical Harassment Sober living homes are not immune to possible tenant harassment by managers or other tenants. There can lapses of judgment or sobriety that can result in a lawsuit being slapped on the owner or operator regardless of how well they know the manager and tenants. Coverage from some carriers is mandatory in some states due to the litigious exposure. Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance plays an important role in a sober living environment. A data breach with HIPPA law information could require out of pocket expenses as well as payments to third parties who may sue for damages. We can review and determine what your individual needs are. Workers Compensation Workers compensation for sober living homes covers employees inured on the job or for work related illnesses. Additional exposure for those that have vehicles whether owned by the company or individually by the employee. Umbrella – Excess Umbrella insurance provides additional layers of protection to your existing insurance policies. Some third parties will require higher limits than standard policies provide.. We’ll help find the right solution to cover all your business needs Quote now Coping with Challenges in Sober Living Operations: Top Ten Concerns and Solutions Feb 20, 2024Operating a sober living home involves navigating a complex web of legal, ethical, and medical responsibilities. Insurance is a critical component in ensuring that you are protected against the array of risks associated with this type of care facility.

On Wednesday, a strong upper-level trough is forecasted to sit over the Northern Great Plains. A strong jet streak is also forecasted to extend from the Ohio River Valley up into the New England region. Through Wednesday into Thursday, a surface low-pressure system is forecasted to move from Texas Northeastward through the Ohio River Valley and up into New England. This low-pressure system will extend a cold front into the Southeastern United States. There’s good model agreement that the cold front should move through the Daytona Region around midnight Thursday into Friday. Ahead of this front on Thursday afternoon, models also agree on scattered thunderstorms initiating prior to the front moving through. Timing could vary, but as of right now expect storms to be in the area from 4PM to 7 PM on Thursday. After these storms move through, the convection that was initiated by the cold front should die out before reaching Daytona. After the cold front moves through, Some showers could linger around the region through the day. Expect skies to calm into Saturday.As we move into the weekend, a second upper-level trough is forecasted to move through the US. The trough is forecasted to deepen as it moves Eastward, and by Saturday afternoon lead to a surface low-pressure system forming over Mississippi. As we work into Saturday night into Sunday, this surface low-pressure system is forecasted to move Northeastward. This low-pressure system is forecasted to be much stronger than the previous one and should be further South. This will lead to a stronger trailing cold front impacting the Daytona Region sometime on Sunday. Again, it’s too far out to give any accurate timing on the frontal passage, but current models have it passing the Daytona Region sometime between Noon & 6 PM, BUT EXPECT THIS TO CHANGE AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE 500.We will continue to update the forecast throughout the week!Updated February 12, 2025, 10:50 AM EDT AdvertisingSpace Available Daytona Beach, Florida WEATHER AdvertisingSpace Available More about Daytona International Speedway The history of Daytona International Speedway began in 1953 when Bill France Sr. realized the days of racing on the beach were numbered due to spreading land usage of a rapidly growing population and huge race crowds.
