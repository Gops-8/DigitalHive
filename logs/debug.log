This triggered us to advertise medals through online and print media to promote the Headlands’ portfolio and further illustrate the unique selling points of our products. “With international food and spirits awards proliferating, it can become unclear what the worth of a gold medal is.

Most incorrectly believe that standard homeowner/landlord insurance policies will cover them and their business. They could not be more wrong! A sober living home is a business and needs proper insurance. Not only is there liability and property exposure but there is also professional liability, workers compensation, and sexual and physical harassment exposure.. add it all up and you have a need for a comprehensive commercial policy. The good news: You have come to the right place! Simply click on the Get Quote button and let our agents get you the right coverage at the right price! Quote now Commercial Liability Even though you may only have a few tenants, there are always uncertainties. We help provide the best risk management advice to protect your business and assets. Liability could protect you from the acts of your tenants as well as guests. Property Coverage Whether you own or rent the home, there is a good chance you need to insure it. Even more importantly is that coverage may also include loss of rents in the event of a covered claim. That coverage alone could save you from financial ruin! Business Auto – Non-Owned Auto If you have a business vehicle then we can help, however, if you have a house manager use their own car and do a few errands for the home you may have an exposure. We can add hired/non owner coverage to protect the operator in the event an employee drives their own car in the name of the business. Professional Liability – Errors and Omissions Perhaps the most misunderstood and under-utilized coverage for a Sober Living Home is professional liability. It is also known as Errors and Omission (E&O). Most of your tenants have come to you because they have relied on your advice or expertise. The reliance on your expertise creates possible exposure that only this coverage can provide. Often, we are told that there is simply a standard tenant landlord relationship. But that does not hold up when there are morning rituals, counseling, trips to 12 step and more. To protect your business and income, you need to have professional liability Sexual & Physical Harassment Sober living homes are not immune to possible tenant harassment by managers or other tenants. There can lapses of judgment or sobriety that can result in a lawsuit being slapped on the owner or operator regardless of how well they know the manager and tenants. Coverage from some carriers is mandatory in some states due to the litigious exposure. Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance plays an important role in a sober living environment. A data breach with HIPPA law information could require out of pocket expenses as well as payments to third parties who may sue for damages. We can review and determine what your individual needs are. Workers Compensation Workers compensation for sober living homes covers employees inured on the job or for work related illnesses. Additional exposure for those that have vehicles whether owned by the company or individually by the employee. Umbrella – Excess Umbrella insurance provides additional layers of protection to your existing insurance policies. Some third parties will require higher limits than standard policies provide.. We’ll help find the right solution to cover all your business needs Quote now Coping with Challenges in Sober Living Operations: Top Ten Concerns and Solutions Feb 20, 2024Operating a sober living home involves navigating a complex web of legal, ethical, and medical responsibilities. Insurance is a critical component in ensuring that you are protected against the array of risks associated with this type of care facility.

On Wednesday, a strong upper-level trough is forecasted to sit over the Northern Great Plains. A strong jet streak is also forecasted to extend from the Ohio River Valley up into the New England region. Through Wednesday into Thursday, a surface low-pressure system is forecasted to move from Texas Northeastward through the Ohio River Valley and up into New England. This low-pressure system will extend a cold front into the Southeastern United States. There’s good model agreement that the cold front should move through the Daytona Region around midnight Thursday into Friday. Ahead of this front on Thursday afternoon, models also agree on scattered thunderstorms initiating prior to the front moving through. Timing could vary, but as of right now expect storms to be in the area from 4PM to 7 PM on Thursday. After these storms move through, the convection that was initiated by the cold front should die out before reaching Daytona. After the cold front moves through, Some showers could linger around the region through the day. Expect skies to calm into Saturday.As we move into the weekend, a second upper-level trough is forecasted to move through the US. The trough is forecasted to deepen as it moves Eastward, and by Saturday afternoon lead to a surface low-pressure system forming over Mississippi. As we work into Saturday night into Sunday, this surface low-pressure system is forecasted to move Northeastward. This low-pressure system is forecasted to be much stronger than the previous one and should be further South. This will lead to a stronger trailing cold front impacting the Daytona Region sometime on Sunday. Again, it’s too far out to give any accurate timing on the frontal passage, but current models have it passing the Daytona Region sometime between Noon & 6 PM, BUT EXPECT THIS TO CHANGE AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE 500.We will continue to update the forecast throughout the week!Updated February 12, 2025, 10:50 AM EDT AdvertisingSpace Available Daytona Beach, Florida WEATHER AdvertisingSpace Available More about Daytona International Speedway The history of Daytona International Speedway began in 1953 when Bill France Sr. realized the days of racing on the beach were numbered due to spreading land usage of a rapidly growing population and huge race crowds.

Casa Traca is een kleinschalige en informele Bed and Breakfast in midden Portugal. Een rustige plek weg van het massa toerisme maar toch centraal gelegen in de gemeente Arganil, Coimbra. Bij B&B Casa Traca staat genieten voorop. Genieten van dit mooie land in al haar facetten. Genieten van het niets hoeven, onthaasten en ontstressen. Dit gevoel van thuiskomen op vakantie wil ik mijn gasten graag meegeven! De tuin, met haar vele loungeplekken, staat geheel ter beschikking voor jullie, mijn gasten. B&B Casa Traca ligt halverwege de de berg Monte' Alto . Vanuit de tuin wandelt u zo naar de top van de berg met de prachtige kapel en het fabuleuze uitzicht. Casa Traca beschikt over 4 royale themakamers waar u heerlijk tot rust kan komen, na bijvoorbeeld een vakantiedag naar de watervallen van Fraga da Pena en het leistenendorp Píodão. Gelegen in het beschermde natuurgebied van Serra do Açor; Serra do Açor Protected Landscape . Ik hanteer het hele jaar door dezelfde prijzen. Zo heeft u ook in het hoogseizoen een betaalbare vakantie in onze accommodatie in Arganil om te ontspannen en te genieten!

U vindt Casa Traca in het authentieke dorpje Valbona. In Valbona lijkt de tijd te hebben stilgestaan. Er is een kleine dorpswinkel annex café. Er zijn bossen om heerlijke wandelingen te maken, bergen voor de prachtigste bergtochten met de auto of de motor. Rivieren om te zwemmen en te kayakken, watervallen om te genieten van de kracht van de natuur. Ook een dagje strand aan de Atlantische Oceaan is geen probleem: Figueira da Foz ligt op een uurtje rijden. Bed and Breakfast Casa Traca in Arganil maakt onderdeel uit van de Serra do Açor Protected Landscape. Casa Traca is hiervoor aangesloten bij de organisatie Natural.pt /ICNF Portugal.

Installment Loans: Complete Guide on Types, Benefits, and Application ProcessFor personal finance, a reliable partner is vital for borrowers who want beneficial financial solutions. It is important to learn about installment loans fully to empower borrowers with financial tools that can empower them to fulfill their diverse needs.According to a recent study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), individuals who grasp the fundamentals of installment loans are more likely to manage their finances effectively and avoid common pitfalls.Let’s check out what experts of Cascade Springs Loan have to tell you about installment loans.What Are Installment Loans?At its core, an installment loan is a straightforward financial tool. It’s a sum of money borrowed from a lender that you repay in fixed, regular installments over an agreed-upon period. Each payment covers both the principal amount and interest, providing clarity on your repayment schedule.The mechanics are simple. When you take out an installment loan, you receive a lump sum. You then commit to repaying this amount, plus interest, in fixed portions over the loan term. Monthly payments remain consistent, making budgeting more manageable.Installment loans serve various purposes. They’re often employed for significant expenses like home repairs, medical bills, or unexpected emergencies. Additionally, they can be used for planned investments, such as education or home improvement. The flexibility of installment loans makes them a practical choice for navigating life’s financial challenges with predictability.Types of Installment LoansPayday loans are short-term loans designed to cover immediate expenses until your next paycheck. They typically involve smaller amounts and shorter repayment periods compared to other installment loans.Features and Eligibility CriteriaSpeed: Quick approval and disbursement, often within a day.Eligibility: Usually requires proof of income, a checking account, and identification.Amount: Generally smaller amounts based on your income.Pros and ConsPros:Immediate financial relief.Minimal documentation.Cons:Higher interest rates.Short repayment period can lead to a cycle of borrowing.Installment loans are a more flexible borrowing option. They involve borrowing a lump sum and repaying it in fixed, regular installments over a more extended period.Features and BenefitsPredictable Payments: Monthly payments remain consistent, aiding in budgeting.Higher Amounts: Generally, installment loans allow for larger loan amounts.Extended Terms: Longer repayment periods, providing more time to repay.Wondering how it differs from payday loans? Here are some main variations:Repayment Structure: Paying back in fixed installments over a more extended period.Amount and Terms: Typically involves larger amounts and more extended repayment terms compared to payday loans.Interest Rates: While interest rates vary, they are often more reasonable than payday loans.Understanding the distinctions between payday loans and installment loans empowers borrowers to choose the option that aligns best with their financial needs.Secured vs. Unsecured Installment LoansSecured installment loans involve providing collateral, which is an asset that acts as security for the loan. This can be anything from a vehicle to valuable possessions. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender can claim the collateral.AdvantagesLower Interest Rates: Secured loans often have lower interest rates due to the reduced risk for the lender.Higher Approval Odds: Collateral provides assurance, making approval more likely.DisadvantagesRisk of Asset Loss: Failing to repay could result in the loss of the collateral.Stricter Eligibility: Requirements may include a valuable asset, limiting accessibility for some.Unsecured installment loans do not require collateral. Approval is based on the borrower’s creditworthiness, income, and financial history.BenefitsNo Asset Risk: Borrowers don’t risk losing personal asse

Cats knead for different reasons. Nursing kittens knead to assist their mothers in producing milk. Adult cats who have been nursing kittens may also knead for comfort. However, some mature cats knead on their owner’s laps to express affection, while others knead, stimulating their sense glands to mark their territory. Why Do Cats Have Whiskers? Whiskas follicles are surrounded by sensory cells. These sensory cells guide cats through daily functions. It activates the cat’s sense of solid objects when touched, helping them to navigate the environment. Likewise, it also aids vision and is a medium for communication. Whiskas show movement when cats are stressed. Why Do Cats Wag Their Tails? Cats communicate their feelings by wagging their tails. If your cat thumps their tail, it implies that they are upset and something is irritating them. Similarly, twitching the end of the tail indicates that they are playing or hunting, but it could also indicate that your cat is moderately upset if they are not playing. If your cat is swinging its tail from side to side, it could indicate that they are paying attention to something. If your cat’s tail quivers, it suggests it is pleased to see you or another cat.

Cats are crepuscular beings which means that they are more active when it’s twilight, such as when hunting for their prey at night. What is a group of cats called? The group of cats is known as a clowder or a glaring. If there are two cats, it is termed a pair, and if there are three or more cats, it is called a clowder. The word clowder comes from the word clodder in Middle English, which was introduced in the late
